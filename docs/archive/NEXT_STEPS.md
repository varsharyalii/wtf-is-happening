## 📝 Your Action Items

### 1. Edit `data/episodes.json` - Fill in Metadata

Open `/Users/varsha.ryali/wtf-is-happening/data/episodes.json` and update the TODO fields:

**For Episode 1 (2B8gABDfh7I) - Dara Khosrowshahi:**
```json
{
  "id": "ep_2B8gABDf",
  "title": "Building Uber with Dara Khosrowshahi",
  "guest": "Dara Khosrowshahi",
  "guest_expertise": "CEO, Uber; Former CEO, Expedia",
  "industry_tags": ["mobility", "delivery", "autonomous vehicles", "marketplaces"],
  "episode_themes": ["scaling global businesses", "Indian markets", "EV adoption", "autonomous driving", "gig economy"],
  "date": "2024-XX-XX",  // Find the actual date from YouTube
  "youtube_url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=2B8gABDfh7I",
  "youtube_video_id": "2B8gABDfh7I",
  "duration_minutes": 90,  // Estimate or check YouTube
  "transcript": "..." // Already filled
}
```

**For Episode 2 (SfOaZIGJ_gs):**
- Read through the transcript or check the YouTube page
- Fill in: title, guest, guest_expertise, industry_tags, episode_themes, date, duration_minutes

### 2. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
# Get one from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" >> .env
```

### 3. Download More Episodes (Optional but Recommended)

For better cross-episode queries, download 2-3 more episodes:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Download more transcripts (replace with actual WTF podcast video IDs)
python scripts/download_transcript.py "ANOTHER_VIDEO_ID"
python scripts/download_transcript.py "YET_ANOTHER_VIDEO_ID"
```

**Recommended diversity:**
- ✅ Dara (Mobility/Tech) - Already have
- 🔲 Fintech founder (e.g., Kunal Shah - CRED)
- 🔲 EV/Manufacturing (e.g., Bhavish Aggarwal - Ola)
- 🔲 Consumer tech (e.g., Ritesh Agarwal - OYO)
