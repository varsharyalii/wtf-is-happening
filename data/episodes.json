    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] Wow, that looks very dead. [Music] and the background. You had a good you had a good day here. It's hot though, right? It's typical SF weather. Ah, yesterday was super super cold. I haven't been outside so I didn't know it was hot today. You live here? No, New York now. Oh, I moved to New York recently sadly. I like it here more. But really parents are in New York. So, I wanted to They're getting older. New York seems like a lot more fun. The city is more fun, but I SF is beautiful. [Music] Where are you based? Based out of India. Okay. Where? I live between Bangalore, Mumbai and Goa in India. Okay. Have you been recently? Uh I go once a year. I don't remember. I I was there earlier this year. Yeah. But like it at least. Yeah. It's so like it's just the energy is incredible and the teams you know we got and I think it's Hyderabad and Bangalore. We got teams there and it's just a like a group who is super excited. The energy you get out of the teams when you go visit them is it's pretty awesome. I like it a lot. What's happening in India D with I know your main competition is Ola who's also a really good friend of mine. Yes. We live in the same city. Yes. Well, have we officially started? Yeah. All right. Good. Okay. Um Ola used to be our main competition. Mhm. Uh and you know we were always going head-to-head with Ola in terms of the category position in the marketplace. They were the local competitor. I think we had the better global tech etc. But they were always scrappy. Um I think he got uh somewhat distracted by other interesting areas uh for him. So I say now the the the tougher competition in India is Rapido. You know they're the upstart. They got into two wheelers and three-wheelers really aggressively super simple model just kind of this subscription zero commission model very scrappy as well and they have gained a good amount of category position. I think Ola is now kind of a distant third. Mhm. They're trying to get into four-wheelers now. So we when we talk about India, other than the talent that we have there and building there and really building out our talent base, but when we when we talk about the business in India and it's the third largest country in terms of mobility trips, so India is really important to us, the competition that we talk about is really rapid. And what do you think Rapido is getting right that the others are not? Um you I'm not on the ground but I think Rapido uh built a really simple model which is basically you know the subscription model you pay a certain amount and for the rest of the day you operate on what's essentially zero commission right uh and once you pay the subscription then because Rapido's essentially taking a zero commission Mhm. then the the driver pay is higher than a player than a player who like us who's taking a commission on every trip. So I think that was a smart way for them to break into the marketplace. Rapido is not making money. So the real test of the business isn't how fast you can grow if you're spending. Um it's actually how fast you can grow while you're profitable. And I think Rapido is a long way away from that. But they've been innovative. They've been scrappy. They move fast. Um, it's a it's a they're they're building their brand there in the local market. So, we've got a lot of respect for them. Uh, and you know, we intend to compete really hard with them. Nice. So, Dra, this podcast that we do is largely focused around young wannabe entrepreneurs in India. Mhm. and the spaces that you operate in uh be it mobility delivery uh may I also say autonomous vehicles electric vehicles these are taking up significant mind share in the dialogue that's happening back home uh so at the end of today if I can arrive at some takeaways that one could use in India to build around any of these sectors will be incredible But maybe we start with you the individual and you give us a few minutes on where you began and how you arrived to where you are today. Yeah, absolutely. So I was uh born in Iran. Mhm. Uh and during when I was born in Iran, the shaver was really trying to modernize Iran very quickly. And I was part I was very lucky to be a part of a family that was part of the industrialization of of Iran. There's a our family ran a group Albor's group and then within it manufacturing companies like Tli Daru which uh were manufacturing we licensed pharmaceuticals from the west and then manufacture them in Iran and then distribute them in Iran and the and the Middle East. It was a big business. We were very well-known family. My my father was in charge of building out all the factories and our family was raised with assumption that we would then step into the family business and and and keep growing and it was a really exciting time. Can I digress and ask a question? Whenever I read about Iran's history, when I talk to the young folk, the shast time seems to have been this great time. What happened? Why did it change? Why did the regime change? Well, I think it was a great time for uh people who were lucky enough to participate in the modernization of Iran. The fact was it like crony capitalism? I don't I don't know enough, but I think that to some extent in hindsight, in hindsight's 2020, I think that Shaw tried to monize too quickly. Mhm. I think that he was too focused on building out military power. So in terms of the growth of GDP in Iran, a significant amount went to establishing Iran as the power center of the Middle East or the military power center of the Middle East versus the industrial power center of the Middle East. Uh and I think he didn't bring along the outskirts, the people who lived in smaller cities, etc. Mhm. And part of his modernization left Islam behind. Uh and Iran as a culture is much more ancient than Islam. Mhm. But Islam is part of the society as well. And so his moving too fast, his focusing on military power versus his people, his focus on kind of the big cities versus everybody. Mhm. Uh, you know, rhymes with maybe things that have happened here, uh, created a movement and an opportunity for the Islamic regime to come in. So people tend to romanticize the past. Now, do I think that the time under the sha was a better time? Absolutely. I think what's happened with the Islamic regime um you know there's a regime that isn't uh I think doing the Iranian people right uh and cares about things other than the um the benefit of the people there and I and I think that's it's disappointing um and it's been there for too long in my opinion but you know every time has good and it's bad and unfortunately the sha wasn't able to follow through on a movement that had a lot of promise and I think the the biggest promise in my estimation was was the value of education uh and women went to college etc. The number of women graduates in Iran actually is higher than than the number of men graduates. So there were a lot of seeds planted there that had a lot of promise and hopefully hopefully Iran can get out of I think now its obsession with Islam and think more about its people uh and building out for the good of the people in concert with Islam but not subjugated to Islam. Does it get in the way in any way today? The fact that your origins are there while the countries where you live today and that might be in conflict. Not not a conflict in my life. Um, you know, there's a sadness and leaving your home country. I mean, my country is now the United States and we got to rebuild in the US and I'm so thankful for it. But would I love to go back? I would. uh but to some extent the the culture of Iran matches the western culture. It's a group of people who want to build. It's a group of people who value education, who are ambitious. Um so I don't find it a conflict with who I am now. But there's a part of me that I feel is incomplete and will be incomplete if I never am able to go back to Iran. I have Iranian friends who live in India now. Yes. And most of them mimic your emotion in thinking that here's a land that had so much opportunity. Incredible. But just religion seems to have caused so much harm than good in that particular geography. And and it doesn't have to. There there are many things about religion that are beautiful. But um again, I think what's happened in Iran is uh it's really unfair to the people there. Are you religious, Dar? I'm not religious. I'd say I'm spiritual, right? Uh but I'm not religious. I, you know, I I I believe in the power of humanity. And I think religion uh is plays to what makes us human and the relationships between us and the deep deep good in all of us and uh I think it's it's beautiful. you know, religions, the stories, uh, the beliefs are are beautiful. And so I describe myself more as spiritual, but for me, my belief is in the good of humanity. At the very core, do you think that is what religion is? Stories, great stories. I think yeah. Um, you know, if you if if you kind of go through the there's an intellectual exercise I I heard which is if if all of our memory was wiped out Yeah. and you rebuilt religions on Earth, there's a high probability that the nature of those religions and the stories would be different. If you rebuilt science, the science will come out the same. And so I do think that there are deep truths there are deep human truths to uh to religion and those deep truths are unchanging but each religion are definitely different ways of getting to those similar deep truths. What is spirituality to you? A lot of people ask me if I'm spiritual and I'm like what is it? I'm trying to figure out what the word even means to begin with. I think it's a great question. Uh for me, what spirituality means to me is a belief in the goodness of humanity, a belief in, you know, you and I have so little in common in terms of where we came from and maybe our uh stories, but so much in common. We've sat together in five minutes and there's a connection there. Mhm. Uh, and I don't think that connection is because of a logical construct that I'm here to speak to you on a podcast that are, you know, like I'm not faking it. Mhm. Right. There's a connection that we're establishing now having this discussion. That to me is a spiritual connection. It's not a logical construct. You know, you're not being nice to me because you think you have to be and vice versa. Um, instantly you have that rapport. And sometimes, by the way, you don't with some certain people. That comes from a spiritual side. And that spirit can be uh captured for good and it can be captured for evil as well. So, in a way, we're all connected somehow like trees and roots. Uh, you know, literally, I don't know, but yes, I do think there's a deeper connection um within humanity. And listen, there's there are some people who attribute that to perfectly logical causes, right? the love that you have. Do you have family? Do you have brothers and sisters? Yeah. You know, there are certain people who would say that your um what do you have? Brother. Yeah. Your love for your brother is based on the genetic similarity of you two. So, it's actually while you may ascertain that to a deep love that you have for family, it's actually purely logically based on your existence as a bunch of genes who wants to continue those genes. and your brother has a genetic makeup that's quite similar to you. So what you view as familial love is actually adaptation that is feeding you that familial love. There is a logical explanation to all this. I kind of choose to acknowledge that but I view that the outcome of that is spirituality. Now it may be based on genetic logic between all of us but I think that outcome is um beautiful and I'd rather keep it at the spiritual level versus say oh it's all it's just us being um gene machines that are trying to uh continue our genes indefinitely would make a case for liking people who are genetically similar to us as well because we similar genes appropriate. Yeah, absolutely. I I feel a connection to Iran, a deep connection to Iran. Why? Um I came here when I was 9 years old. We're now back at history, right? Uh and I I have to say one thing. Uh I was in your old office yesterday. Yes. And Alan and Co. I was meeting somebody for something and you know Bob Kerry. Uh yes, I've met him. I don't know Bob very well, but I've met him. Yeah. So they were telling me you should ask D. And I said I'm meeting you the next day. And they were telling me you should ask DH when he used to be here. He used to say he doesn't believe in globalization. Is that because genes away from one geography become too far. Boy, that was Bob's takeaway from I don't even remember that. I don't if I was trying to like upset him or something like that. I don't believe in globalization. I don't know what that means or I don't know what I meant at the time. But I do think that, you know, again, you could the that that connection I have with Iran, I believe is a spiritual connection. I don't know where it comes from because I'm so American, right? I've I've lived uh the vast majority of my life um as an American. I've been incredibly lucky to be here, but there's a part of me that feels empty if I don't go back. Uh and you know that's probably a spiritual connection. Again you could put a genetic underlying cause to it but I like the story of that being spirituality more. I get that. I think I feel that in India strongly. Yeah. So nine year nine you move here. Yeah. So we had uh the Iranian the revolution happened the Islamic revolution happened. um little story which is uh we we were intending to stay at one point but then I think the the house across the street from us was related to the Shawam house. So some revolutionary guards jumped wanted to go attack that house and they jumped over went through our uh garden um I think their guns went off so shots went off so bullets came through our house and at that point my mom said we're getting out of here. Wow. Uh, so we went to the south of France. We were a wealthy family. We had a place there. And really the intent was to go to to the south of France until things calmed down. Mhm. Well, things never calmed down. Uh, we happened to have an uncle who's still alive now. He's 101 years old. Uncle Nasola who uh lived in the US. He married a Faith um a uh an American woman, wonderful, wonderful uh auntie. And so we came to the US to stay with them. And then we knew we could never go back. Mhm. Uh and we started a life here. So I've been in the US ever since I was 9 years old. Iranians are quite wealthy. Whenever I go to I realize this when I go to Beverly Hills and everybody's Iranian. Why is that? Well, I think the Iranians who were wealthy got to go got to leave. Uh and you know Iranians there were pretty entrepreneurial culture and a lot of Iranians invested in real estate. You know we came here in the uh late 1970s ' 80s and it was a good time to come to America and establish yourself and get into business in the US. Uh and my family did the same. My family did the same. But the it it was really for the kids. I was only 9 years old. I I think children are able to adjust to change much more readily. You know, for us, like America was this magic uh country where I went from like three channels in Iran to 35 channels cable. I couldn't understand the language very well. But we adjusted really well and and we always had our family around us. But it was much harder for my parents. You know, my my father his whole life was business and he he took a shot at some entrepreneurial businesses. they didn't work out very well and without work he kind of um didn't have a a cause in his life. Um he went back to Iran cuz his father was dying. So I didn't see him I think between the ages of 13 and 19 cuz they wouldn't let him out of the country for those six years. Um and my mom who lived a life of absolute luxury had to go back to work. She worked as a salesperson. uh at Nordstrom Seline and you know it it was a very very difficult adjustment for them but for the kids we always had family we got to go to private school and we got to have the kind of education that then afforded us the opportunities that we've taken advantage of of since so you started school here where in America uh in Westchester County New York about uh an hour of New York at a wonderful school called Hackley School and then I went to uh Brown university and studied engineering at Brown University. Uh, and then I was going to an engineering management program and I met a commodity trader, a woman in New York City who I completely fell in love with and I had to find a job in New York City and the only jobs available in New York City were investment banking jobs and so that's how I got to Allen and Company that you just talked about and I worked at Allen and Company for I think it was like eight years or so. Mhm. Um, and one of my clients there was a gentleman named Barry Diller. Uh, who was this legendary um, uh, figure in media and and then, uh, very much in within the internet and I he was a client of mine and I remember like my intention was to stay at Allen & Company forever. It is a great familyrun business. uh really look out for your clients. You know, it's not the kind of investment bank that's looking for fees. They want to help you build a business. So, I thought I was going to be there forever, but then I saw Barry. I say, if if I ever get a chance to work for that guy Mhm. I'll take it in a second. Why was that? Why was Barry Was Barry interesting or Expedia interesting? Um this was before Expedia. It It was all Barry. he was um every time he came into a room, the whole room would light up. Uh it just the the energy that he carried with him was extraordinary. And I'll tell you a little story of of when we met. Um, and it's a lesson that I learned in in in business was that he uh he was bidding for uh he he was running a company called QVC, which was home shopping, bidding for Paramount, which was the uh the company that he he used to run. So, it's like his coming home. Uh, and I was the little crappy analyst who was running his his deal model. And at one point, you know, the the numbers started getting really high. He's like, \"I want to meet the person who built this deal model.\" And you know, usually with these investment banks, you like have a managing director and a vice president and an associate. And he's like, \"No, I want to meet the person. I want this person to take me through the model.\" And so, he comes in and I'm like so nervous. I'm about to like die. And he forced me to like take him through every single line of this model so he could understand what he was doing. And the lesson that I learned from him was that every time you you know the the higher up you get an organization and it's something that I really think about now the more procured uh your version of what's happening in the real world becomes. You have a chief of staff who controls your uh your schedule the the and so all the information flow to you becomes controlled. Mhm. And as the information flow comes up to you, it gets edited and edited and edited and all the edges leave and you essentially get access to the information that the organization wants you to have. And the biggest mistakes that I see with businesses is not usually errors of judgment, but you just didn't really know what was going on in the organization. And Barry went right to kind of the source. He didn't want the editing. He didn't want the smooth presentation this or that. And so he wanted to get it to the source. You know, I did okay because then he hired me as his banker. And I just fell in love with to everyone now like what happens to CEOs because of the management teams and so on and so forth. to normal people. Is everybody by virtue of using large language models today getting a version that if they did it manually they would have they would have discovered that there are other versions possible. Definitely. Is it making us all stupid? I mean listen it it's it it's it's not making all of us stupid but if you are lazy enough to just depend on that version of reality because it's a very easy version of reality available to you then you could possibly be stupid. And so that's a a sometimes as in organizations, you know, the organization takes over the flow of information up the the organization, etc. And one lesson that I learned from Barry is like the way you fight that is to create these random matches, etc. to fight the organization's um need to package everything for you because it's the things that you don't know that ultimately, you know, hit you on the side of the head that make you vulnerable. Um and so it's a it's a very long-winded story, but uh eventually Barry lost that deal. He then started um with in partnership with John Malone who's another kind of legend in the entertainment industry uh home shopping network and started rolling up some other uh assets. And at that point he he did a big deal with USA Networks. He didn't have any staff to help him out. And at that point he hired me to be his deal person and I followed him. So then we kind of took the he he was really Barry was really interested in the intersection of entertainment with interactivity. Um and this is like during the AOL days etc. Uh and and we actually got lucky because we bought a company called Ticket Master. Um I don't know if Ticket Master operates in India but like you know they they would sell but I remember it. Yeah. And in the olden days, the way that Ticket Master would sell tickets was either you would go to like a Tower Record store and like wait in line for the Madonna concert or you would call Ticket Master kind of call call to to get these tickets. And they did a deal with America Online. And whoosh, the volumes went online. And so at that point, Dyer and I were like, \"Okay, what else looks like tickets? It's a virtual good, advanced ticketing, reserve seats. What else looks or rhymes with transactions happening either over the phone or, you know, across a desk? Um, and because the transactions are virtual, you don't have shipping costs, etc. We didn't want to compete with Jeff Bezos. Let's it go after those companies that are offline because we know all the stuff is going to move online. So, that led us to, for example, travel. You know, in the olden days, you would go to the travel agency or you would call a travel agent to book travel like that's going to go online. So, we started buying businesses that were either offline that were moving online or some of the early online travel companies like Expedia. Uh we went into the personals business, mass.com. In the olden days, you would call and be like, \"Hi, I'm Da and I'm I'm 5'9. I'm 6'2 and this and that.\" you know, like you leave your profile online and someone else would pick that profile. All this stuff went online. So, it was a really wonderful adventure of finding businesses that we thought would take advantage of this movement of um of uh offline to online. Travel was a huge category that we invested in. I went from being Barry's deal person to being his chief financial officer. And then at one point the travel business um it had this incredible growth but it hit some turbulence and at that point uh uh Barry needed a CEO and I was dumb enough to raise my hand. I said hey maybe I can run this thing and that's when I took over what became uh Expedia and I ran Expedia for 13 years. Barry was always a chairman. I was the CEO of the company and it was a great run. We had a great run together. How does travel change next? D I think it's a industry which has stagnated a bit in terms of how one books. At least my experience online of booking a ticket, a hotel hasn't changed that much in the last few years. Yeah, I I don't think that the travel industry's innovated that much. I I think you're exactly right and it frustrates me, you know, which is like what it the booking experience looks quite similar. I think one obvious answer is the Gent experience which is can you actually get AI agents or um uh LM agents to book the travel for you to to go to the various sites and compare uh compare uh prices etc and and book for you. So, I think that part of the travel booking experience can be easier having agents work for you. I think that the discovery part of the travel experience can get much much better. This is I think one area where LM today shine because if you thought in the again probably 10 years ago I want to go someplace over the summer how you would figure out where to go it would be you would maybe read a magazine or go online or talk to friends or you heard about something the way to gather information or go to Google which I think could be quite frustrating you know luxury vacation in Europe like the the results you get are trash in my opinion. um with LLMs now actually their ability to gather the information and bring you unexpected results etc. I think travel discovery is going to get much much better and is much better today. Mhm. Um travel booking I think agents can help you as well. And then I think one area that I think Uber is really good at that I think the experience can improve significantly is your inmarket experience. You know why is it that when you land and you take the Uber to the to your hotel you even need to check in right we should we have your phone we know where you are. come into the room, you know, you're why can't it be you're in room uh, you know, 30 31E and just go up there? You already checked in and go in, you know, why do I need to sit there and, you know, have the perfectly nice person ask me if I had a nice flight and, you know, here's my room, etc. I think the in market experience is something that hasn't been innovated on at all and it's something that could improve as well. Yeah, I'm able to today discover, say I'm coming to San Francisco. Yes. And I want to figure out which hotel suits my needs. I can enter my taste each time and the agent will recommend something. But is there one place where I don't have to think and agent can do everything? I don't think there's one solve for it today. No. And and there definitely isn't one place today. I I do think the cost of a bad decision in travel is very high. Yeah. So I don't think you're going to get to a place and I'm certainly not going to get to a place where I tell an agent to find me a hotel in San Francisco and just book it and then you know on the day when I arrive there I'm like where am I going? Yeah. Um, but I think agents can do a great job of of reducing, you know, that list that on Expedia, you look at the 50 hotels and then you're filtering for, you know, maybe where you're looking or the class of hotels. Um, it it can collate, it can give you the three hotels that you're most likely to like based on your historical experiences. So I think there's this in between space and I think agents can do a great job in that in between space but I think that final decision at least for me is going to be up to you. But that coalation that kind of bringing everything together that's a that could be of very very high utility. If you had an idea to build something around travel, Mhm. sitting on the board of Expedia and running Uber at the same time, where do you build what? Um, I think I would build I I would not go after the I would not go after the inspiration side because I think the inspiration side, thank you very much, is is going to be served really really well by an open AI or a Google. They're collecting all the information. and they're going to have lots of context about who you and I are and and the way people get inspired, it's so um disperse, right, that it's going to be very difficult for you to build one service that let's say services 70% of your inspiration. And and I really do think that Google, OpenAI, other LLMs are are going to just get better and better here. But I think the agentic search booking experience and then inmarket experience to make it a very smooth handoff from one experience to the other. I think that's something that I would focus on, you know, with my Expedia and Uber hat on at the same time. Something interesting to build though. I think a lot of opportunity here. It's not solved for at all. Someone's going to get it right. And I I do think one challenge in terms of how the industry is constructed right now is that the OTAAS, the Booking.coms, the Expedias of the world, they have they are very self-interested in making sure that you book within their um their supply base. Mhm. Uh and at the same time outside of that supply base, you know, they're organizing a ton of content, prices, etc. features and information. So there's utility in that. Mhm. The ultimate solution is going to be an agent that can sit above it all and can kind of scour the internet and scour all the booking services and then surface the results which may be a mix and match of all of them for you based on your tastes. So I don't know actually and I hope it's Expedia because I'm on the board and I love the company. I hope it'll be Expedia who puts it all together. Mhm. But there could be kind of an umbrella agent who is truly representing your interest versus Expedia's interest. Now, if Expedia does a great job, they will maybe expand or they will, you know, over a period of time amalgamate all the content on the on the web. So, all the travel content on the web, booking content on the web. So, that super agent doesn't add much value. When you have an umbrella agent, soon you'll have another and then another. Yeah. So will it come down to who is able to extrapolate your taste and can someone's taste be deciphered from past data. You think I I think it's going to be a combination of past data. Um I think that you want an you want an agent that will do some exploration for you, you know. So, for example, when um we are showing you the restaurants that you're likely to want to pick on Uber Eats, if all we show you is the mo is the ones that you're most likely to or based on what you've done in the past, then we're missing that surprise. We're missing that explore. So, you want an agent that's a combination of explore and exploit. Mhm. Um, I think that's going to be so I don't think it's just going to be on your past taste, but it'll be putting your past taste with other people who look like you and then surprising you with some new choices as well. I think that's ultimately going to be the winner. Ultimately, so much will come down to taste, right? In this world, uh, well, listen, taste, convenience, price, right? I mean, you and I may be lucky enough where taste is the overriding factor, but there may be context for you, right? If you're um coming to San Francisco and it's midweek, you may want a cheap, decent place close to the Uber offices, right? And that's a different context than if you are going to go to Napa for the weekend where you want an experience either for yourself, for yourself and friends or loved ones. So, I do think that it's not as simple in terms of taste. is based on the context of what the what what you're um what you're solving for you know your objective function and your objective function is going to change uh based on the context of what the goal of that trip is so D I was trying to define what Uber is today you mentioned Barry and Match.com are you Match.com in a different way I mean to some extent we're bringing uh obviously riders and drivers together and we're trying to meet match eaters with our restaurant partners with a courier. So there is some of that. But listen, I think one way that I think about it from a consumer standpoint, you know, Uber is different thing to Uber to different people. For the consumer, I really want Uber to be like that operating system for your everyday life. You know, we make your everyday life a little bit easier. We give you a little bit of time and convenience back in terms of where you want to go. Um what you want to eat more and more what you want, right? If you want that iPhone same day, we'll do that for you. Uh for our driver and courier partners, we are a source of of of work uh and a source of earnings based on your own needs. Now, you know, and and and you're you're going to balance your needs based on the commercial objectives as well. If your need is that I only want to give rides at 2 a.m. in the morning, you may not make much money. So, there's a combination of, you know, the marketplace combines what when you want to work with the realities of the commercial objectives. Hey, 9:00 p.m. Friday night, you may not want to work, but it's a great time to work in San Francisco. And then for restaurant partners, you know, we're a trusted partner in bringing a source of demand in terms of uh delivery and now retail and groceries that's only going to grow. You know, what we see is the convenience that we offer in terms of uh delivery of starting food now, but everything that convenience is absolutely dynamite. It's pe it's something that people want all over the world and as they experience it more and more people want it. This is funny, but I was I got in last evening. Hope you took an Uber. No, I have a driver here. But uh I wanted an adapter. Uh I'm using a lap I'm using a couple of laptops which have India plug points and I needed a travel adapter. And at 8:30 p.m. I was trying to like IDate. My hotel didn't have one. Sure. Uh Target, Best Buy shuts down at 8:00 p.m. Uh Walgreens had one store which was open up until 10:00 p.m. I tried to download Instacart on my phone which said I couldn't do it unless I have a US number. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah. So, did you try Eats? Does Uber Eatats have travel adapters? Yeah. Yes. And can I have an international? One of that's one of the issues with actually the name right when we got out of um when we wanted to expand from food to grocery and other items we actually tested is Uber Eats the right name with consumers and we found that consumers thought that it would carry you know like it's and you've seen a lot of our branding well you may not have seen it because in India we don't have Uber Eats unfortunately it breaks my heart in 2020 right uh yes yes uh we partnered um there We we didn't think we could win in India and we wanted to really focus on mobility. Um but Eats now has groceries, it's got retail and I'll bet you you could have found that travel adapter. So lesson learned for you next time. And by the way, Eats is now available on the on the rides app too. Nice. You sold Uber Eats to Zamato for for 400 500 million. I think you had a 10% equity in Zamato in turn and they got a great deal. Yeah. And then you got out of Zumato altogether as well. Yes. Which is called Eternal. Now I didn't know they changed the name of the company. Why is that? Why did you get out? What did you understand or learn about the Indian market? We we got out not because of some deep thought as it relates to Indian market but my belief that we're not a holding company. We're not investment company. I I am that is not my core competency to take Uber investors capital and invest it really well. My competency is to build a big operating business that over a period of time you know grows topline brings in lots of consumers all over the world and ultimately you know throws off a lot of profitability and and and we can build a a share price. my skill in terms of investment uh is not going to be a significant factor in the value creation here. So I believe in kind of sticking you know could I have had a wonderful intellectual time on trying to determine if if I should sell Zamato now or later or 10 years from now sure but that that's not my core competence. So I want I like to stick to my core competence. Would you buy Zamato today? I don't know. I haven't looked at it actually. Right. Yeah. So I mean they they've done a great job. the food the food delivery business and now the instant grocery business in like blinket I've heard is actually larger than the core business was right so growing faster yeah yeah very much so so Uber is about 57% mobility 30% delivery uh for today I'm going to ignore freight because I think it's growing at the lowest pace as well I get it uh and I'm going to be a 20-year-old boy or girl in India trying to build a business in either mobility, delivery, quick commerce, and maybe we get advice from DH as to what to build and what the opportunities are. Oh, that's a Well, first I'd say don't try to build anything against Uber cuz we'll kick your ass and you can buy us later. How how big are network effects? Because you're already in so many markets and so big. I'm guessing it's very hard to service a customer who wants to hire a Uber at 3:00 a.m. and 3 3:00 a.m. and 6 p.m. Yeah. Unless you have network. Yeah. The the network effects are very very significant. Now, and so I do think that to invest in and build the required liquidity on both sides of the market is going to be very very difficult. Now the network effects to some extent can be local right so the the liquidity that we have in Bangalore may be different from the liquidity that we have in hydrobot so I do think that there's an opportunity and maybe rapid took advantage of that opportunity of building out services in smaller cities and then building out liquidity in a way that's not quite as expensive because you're not trying to take on all of India but go city by city by city and then get into larger cities is um they started with I think two wheelers and three-wheers. They're trying to get into autos etc. So I think if you find a niche where you believe that you can build liquid supply and demand on a local basis and then you can rinse and repeat that over and over again. It's essentially what Travis did when with Uber when he founded it. That is something that could work. Uh and if you get large enough maybe then and it might be a different segment let's say inter city for example or some other segment that isn't particularly well served by the Ubers of the world or the Zamadas of the world or some of the other players then maybe that you can build something that could either compete with them or could be bought by them. That's an interesting insight. Uh, I watched a bunch of your interviews and I'm sorry. No, they were actually really nice. Thank you. Uh, Travis, they say that in in society today as a leader, you're either all inspiring, dogmatic, uh, or you're somebody who builds consensus, is more relatable, per se. Mhm. Have you had to project a more relatable image cuz you have to overcompensate for what Travis was projecting? I one one thing that I really believe in is um I don't think it works if you're trying to be someone other than who you are. You know, people come to me and they they ask me for leadership advice. And the first piece of advice that I give them is be true to yourself because the minute you're not true to yourself, people will smell that a mile off if you're not authentic. You know, this is word that people mean authentic, etc. What does it mean? It's just like be true to who you are. I am uh the youngest brother of a really big family. Mhm. We have like thousands of cousins around. Mhm. And in Iran, community and family is so important. Nobody's the star. And if you're the star, you're going to be put in your place. You know, I'm a fancy fancy CEO here. Uh but when I go to my family, I'm just one of the younger cousins and I'm no big deal. And I love it. It's such a relief to be that person who I just that's my comfort zone. So I tend to be more collaborative. You know, I I when I played sports, I I would play defense. I always played team sports. I didn't want to win as an individual. I love the feeling of winning as a team. I I you know, I don't want to be there celebrating by myself. I always celebrate with my team, right? So that is who I am. And maybe that's one of the reasons why I I wound up here uh here. And actually my challenge as a leader is to get out of that collaborative mode sometimes and to really drive. And for example, I'll give you a little story and it's a funny story but it just taught me a lot. Um we were uh during co Mhm. in the US CO was devastating to our business. Mobility was 90% of our business and by far you know the profitable piece of the business. And overnight we lost 80 85% of our volume. couldn't be worse. And and we went from we were already losing two billion a year. We went from losing two billion a year to like losing four billion a year. It was a disaster. And it became very clear that we had to um undergo layoffs. Mhm. Not a fun time. I never thought I'd come to Uber to to lay off thousands of people. And me being me, I was um talking to my team. What do you think we should do? What are the levels? where should we I didn't want to do a peanut butter kind of a layoff etc. I want to be focused and I would do meeting after meeting after meeting with my team because I wanted them all included and I want to hear what they had to say. and Nelson Chay uh my CFO at the time he we were talking and he's like Dar you know um we have a lot of respect for you and you're a really good person and we've talked about this a lot why don't you just tell us what you want to do cuz you tell us what you want to do we're right behind you and I was like my god like sometimes collaboration etc talking about things doesn't help and as a leader you have to go from collabor you know, from peace time collaboration mode to wartime, like I am the leader, I'm the general, I'm going to make a decision mode. And and there like I didn't sleep that much that night, but the next day I got everyone together. I'm like, here's what we're going to do. We cut deep in operations. We cut less deep on on tech. Um we it was very very difficult, but like we went and everyone was behind me. and while it was a really really difficult time to some extent that brought the team together. Um it allowed Uber Eats to grow to incredible levels. Uh and I think it made us a better company. I would never ever want to go through that again but made us a better company. So for me my um my general comfort zone is collaboration, working with the team, listening to the team. But then what I've learned is there are certain circumstances where you have to switch your modes. And so I'll switch from collaboration to decision. Here's what we're going to do. And because my team sees me listening, collaborating most of the time, I think they give me credit when I say, \"All right, we're going to go this way.\" So it it's who I am. Yeah. I've been noticing, I might be wrong in this, in a David versus Goliath world, David seems to have started winning quite often. Uh, which kind of doesn't make sense because we are largely a trust deficit planet. But a lot of people I know I think it's weirdly correlated to affluence want to pick the smaller guy the smaller brand uh individuals over corporations in such a world I get that relatable makes a lot more sense than all inspiring dogmatic but how does a company like Uber which is uh 40 plus billion in revenue and millions of rides and employees and all of How do you evolve to project the David image while you already have all of this? I I do think that there is first of all I feel like David when you know we're competing in a technology world of trillion dollar plus companies, right? So while we may be a larger company, um I don't feel like we're a big company at Uber. uh we've done well as a company but like I think there's so much more that we can do. So I see our shortcomings much more than our accomplishments and I think that there is um it's part of the culture of the company which is not to overestimate ourselves and and to act like a like a disruptor etc. Do you do that consciously project vulnerability? Um Goliath doesn't I think I think it's kind of who I am. It goes back to my family. There's there's a my father was like a really modest person. Mhm. And he would the minute I kind of thought I was hot I don't know if I'm allowed to say that. You know, he he put me, you know, he he would just throw me on my in my place. So, I think part of it is who I am. I think part of it is is where Uber came from. Remember, like we we were the upstarts. like this company wouldn't exist if we weren't challenging the the the status quo. But how do you continue to look like the upstart tomorrow if the world picks you? I hope so. Now, now I would tell you that internally I do we are upstarts and I want to have that upstart mentality here. We do have to recognize the power that we have and I do think that's a mistake that Uber made early on which is we had to fight for our lives but then at some point you know we did get large we had incredible impact in the cities in which we operated with in and that does come with with that does come with responsibility and so I do think there's there's this weird kind of dualism about our identity which is internally we want to feel like upstarts all the time. Like every single day we're fighting for our lives. Um we we we hire from a lot of big tech companies and we say like come here, you're going to work your ass off. You'll probably make a little bit less money, but you're going to like the work that you do can truly a an individual engineer at Uber can have huge effect across a company. And that that is really cool. And at the same time, the effect that you have on the company also has an effect on society too because we are big. And so there's this dualism that you have to keep within Uber, which is within these walls, we're going to act like a startup, but outside of the walls and discussions we have with regulators and discussions that we have with our drivers, our couriers, our restaurants, recognize we're a big company and that does come with responsibility. Um, and it means that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. This is some advice I want personally. uh at some point Uber had different teams attacking different cities. Yes. For market share and these teams almost competed with each other and netn net it seemed to work well for Uber. I tend to do this very organically with people I have. I don't know if it's good in the long run or bad but I make them compete with each other. Sure. What have you learned? Does it work? um it works as a growth tactic but it doesn't scale. So to some extent what you want to do is you want to have these humans and teams compete against each other to hack your way into the best solution possible. Mhm. Then after they get to that best solution possible, you then have to come in and automate that solution, you know, through alos, through engineering, etc. And then what was the frontier becomes a part of the core and then you move to the next frontier. So that's kind of the design spec that we have. You know, the the team is actually very very entrepreneurial. you know like we Uber teams to some extent was an amalgamation of a bunch of technologies that we built and our CPO Sachin he kind of had he's like he was obsessed with that idea he's like well we have a bunch of safety functionality here we can put together teams with our safest drivers we have tracking functionality here I'm going to put this whole thing together and hack together what you call this teen solution and you hack it you move quickly. You see if there's product market fit and then once you see the signal that there's product market fit, you do have to systematize it because if you don't systematize it, you can't scale. So, you have to have both muscles within the organization, but it's a good way to discover something faster. Totally. You you don't want to like it that that the signal. We don't do this anymore, but at at Expedia in the olden days, you know, we like put a button um on the website just to see if there's demand for that button, and someone, you know, would click it. They'd be like, \"Oh, I'm sorry. is not working right now and we're just doing it to collect signal. You know that that's the biggest hack possible, right? Um so so and once you see that product market fit, you got to you got to build behind it and some companies make the mistake of not building behind it and you can get away with it for a while but at some point the system falls apart. When you speak about Door Dash or when you when you spoke about uh Zomato right now you complimented them, praised them. Uh, I heard you on a interview speaking about how Door Dash went after the suburbs and you guys missed out. You praising competition, is that a way to appear more David in a David versus Goliath world? Again, it it's not it's not a it's not an act, right? Um, I think Door Dash is a really great company. I don't like them. Yeah. But they make us better. Uh, and they're a worthy competitor, global competitor. Uh, they're beating us right now in the US, but not for long. And we're beating them outside the US. And the two companies going against each other makes both companies better and actually builds a better service for consumers and couriers and restaurants all over the world. Um, I I think you know the the humility that we talked about before, I think that actually creates a strength because you're curious. You're not overconfident. You don't think like you're the best in the world. You're curious about what others are doing. Um, and for me, it motivates me and drives me to be better. You know, if I say Door Dash is a is a good competitor and they are a good competitor, that's motivation for me and my team to be better. You said outside US you're beating them and they're beating you here. Does India for long though in the US? Does India as a market matter? Dar you once observed when you were there that Indians are very demanding and they don't want to pay for anything. That that that comment cost me. It um it it matters hugely for us, right? Uh it's India is now our third largest market in terms of mobility trips. Mhm. Uh we've got I think over 1.4 million now drivers, auto you know two wheelers, three-wheers and and four-wheelers in India. Uh the growth there is spectacular. I think India is already one of the great countries in the world but if you look at it as a share of GDP it's only going to increase. uh the leadership there is amazing and and so much of our talent pool not just in India but all over the world comes from Indian descent as well. So India is you know it is a absolute mustwin for Uber not just tomorrow but 10 years from now. I'm going to go back to being a 20-year-old who's starting a business in this industry. You know, I say don't start one in this industry. Go go go try something else. How do I recognize the opportunity versus damn like the total addressable market like if I want to start quick commerce in India and the cost of delivery is say 20 rupees or 30 rupees or 50 rupees. If the total addressable market that can afford a product like that in India be 20 million people or 50 million people where is the number right a lot of the spend a lot of consumption in India is still going towards groceries as much as 50 60%. So how do I justify to myself that my business idea is sound that I'm going to charge 50 rupees a delivery? How many people do I model for? Where does that fit come across geographies? I say you're way overthinking it. Um you know businesses never businesses that succeed are always adapting and adjust and adjusting. So what I tell you is figure out if there's product market fit in that narrow segment. Call it the 50. And by the way, if it's narrow, that's great because then the big players are probably not going to come after it. It's a segment where you can add value and it's a segment where you can own and then if you establish product market fit and you build a business there, then you can go to the next area to the next area to the to the next area. But if my market size is only 20 million people who can afford it, still build it. Build it as long as there's product market fit in terms of unit economics, that makes sense. And once you get to those 20 million people, you're going to find an adjacency to get into. And then you'll find another agency and you'll find another. But then I'm competing with people like you who already are sitting on the network network effects in Yeah. But the the the big TAMs are going to be taking. So actually specifically you should go after the small tamps right and the small opportunities where you can create a network effect without enormous investments either in technology or development or or monies. You you actually specifically should go after the small TAMs and then work your way into the adjacencies over a period of time. I wasn't around, but at the time, you know, the when Uber East was conceived of, I think it was Jason Droi and Travis, they were they were like driving around a bunch of cars with burritos in the trunk of that car. It was it was like a manifestation of mobility. Mhm. Um, a very close manifestation. And you look at where delivery has gone and how large it's become, you know, I don't think they would have ever predicted that. So you just get one step to the next step to the next step. I don't believe in overthinking TAM. I think TAMs are like you build those for IR and you build those to raise money. You may you may want to create this wonderful dramatic TAM to go raise, you know, a couple million bucks. But that's not what should be processing through your mind. It should be can I build a service that has eventually strong unit economics that then I can build on top of. Quickcommerce seems to have sidestepped the US for a long time. I think you went to big box retail and then you went to another thing altogether. Yeah. Not necessarily competing on I will deliver in 6 minutes, I will deliver in seven and I will deliver in eight. Why is that? Because the cost of labor in the US is too high. So I my that that's my take which is um with quick commerce uh you can't automate that much because the cost of the automation doesn't bear out in a small box. So you have to use human labor. Mhm. Uh the co and so in markets where the cost of human labor and is not there and the concentration of of customers isn't there you get a fail. uh which is for example let's say in the US right um you know I think that go is making a good run at it but you look at the development of that market versus uh blinket or some of the other developing markets it is absolutely working much much better in lowerc cost labor markets than it is in high-cost labor markets is there a arbitrage there because your drivers are not essentially employees is there a labor cost arbitrage cuz their gig workers. They run their own cars. They don't need to be paid benefits, insurance. Yeah. There's there's a trade-off there, right? Which is we can't tell our drivers when and when to work, right? So imagine if Starbucks is hiring a barista, they don't go to the barista, hey, show up whenever you want to, and you know, we'll pay you however much a Starbucks barista makes per hour. So you could call it a labor arbitrage. I I call it a trade-off which is the driver and the courier can decide when and where they want to work. That creates cost for us. We then have to build liquidity of of of supply and demand. And sometimes we will use incentives and or algorithms for example surge or circumstances when uh when demand exceeds supply. And in those cases, we have to actually raise prices for that demand in order to attract enough drivers to get out into the market to pick out to pick up everyone, you know, arriving at 7:00 p.m. on a Thursday night at the airport or, you know, when when uh the Warriors uh game is is done, right? So, it it it's it's I wouldn't it's not an arbitrage mechanism. Um it is a tradeoff that also is an enormous benefit to uh certain people who don't want to work on a schedule who want to work less than 40 hours a week. You know 70% of our drivers and couriers are working less than 20 hours a week. So it it is a unique product market fit that we found. It works for drivers and couriers. It works for us. We have to build very complex systems in order to make it work. Um, and I think overall when you look at society, it's it's good for society, right? It's a service both for the drivers and for customers that works and and I think more and more societies are are appreciating that. You've spoken about autonomous vehicles a bunch of times and uh I don't know if it'll happen sooner or later than you predict, but everyone's been wrong so far, so who knows? Well, I mean the predictions generally of autonomous and when they're when it's going to be ready for market, you know, this is a this is a problem that uh Whimo has been working on probably for 15 20 years. Yeah. Um and it's proven out to be a much more difficult problem to solve than anyone expected, but finally it's working now. I mean, the the Whimo product is spectacular and there are others building out the product as well. I was at a junction last evening and there was a fire truck behind a Whimo. Interesting. And I I didn't I couldn't sirens on. The sirens were on and the Whimo actually did this interesting maneuver where it went right, stopped there, waited for the fire truck to go. It was incredible. Yeah. Perfect. What do you think wins? uh Veos tech or Teslas cameras, LAR, radar. I personally believe that autonomous vehicles have to have superhuman levels of safety. I don't think it's good enough for them to be better than humans. They have to be multiple times better than humans. And Whimo's certainly proven that that's possible. So, why not take that shot? Mhm. Um I think in the near term it's going to be very difficult and Elon would tell me I'm wrong and never bet against them but it's my instinct that in the near term it's going to be very difficult to build a camera only product that has superhuman levels of safety. And again now at some point will it be possible? Quite possibly yes. But if you can have um instrumentation that includes cameras and LAR and the cost of LAR, you know, solid state LAR now is 400, 500 bucks. Why not include LAR as well in order to achieve superhuman safety. So possible, yeah, it will be possible. I don't know when, but is the possible the better product? I'm not sure. I would I all of our partners um that we're working with now are using a combination of uh camera, radar, and LAR. And you know, I personally think that's that's the right solution, but I could be proven wrong. What happens to Uber's earners when if autonomous becomes safer and cheaper? Mhm. One could argue that putting a human behind a wheel is a disservice because you're putting somebody at risk. At that point, what happens to all the earners who are working with Uber? Well, I think it's not just earners. It's it's then why should humans drive, right? Society would be uh I think there are about a million auto related fatalities in the world. So, why not save those lives? Um I I think that that is it's an inevitability for that to happen. So, it's not just drivers, but also bottle drivers, whether professional or not, wouldn't drive anymore. And and I think that would be a good outcome for society. I do think we have time. How much between I think it's a it's a good 20 years, you know, because right now um the drivers, the autonomous drivers are safer but much more expensive uh even in developed markets that have high labor costs. So for autonomous to come into India is going to take a long time in terms of cost of hardware coming down. So so 20 years I'm describing as an end state. You know within 10 years you're going to see a significant number of autonomous vehicles especially in developed markets and I think that's a very good things in terms of safety. Uh, and what we're trying to do is make sure we communicate with our drivers appropriately. And it's very, very small at this point. It's a teeny teeny part of rides in in any markets. And we're actively looking to create other work opportunities for those drivers as well. So for example, I'm actually going to go to a meeting later today of uh a new group that we built, Uber AI solutions that is using our gig workers and then other specialist workers as well for you know AI labeling, translation, all kinds of um needs and products that actually serve these AI models, some of which may be autonomous or not. um that ultimately are going to be doing a bunch more of the manual work not just driving but the manual work that many workers do today. I was having this debate with a friend of mine back in India and they were like autonomous for India with the cows and dogs and carts and all of that. But when you think about it, if a computer has a reaction time which is faster than a human, an autonomous vehicle should do better with more arbitrary things like this at play. Totally. I I I think the it's just a question of training. Um and if uh if autonomous vehicles can figure out New York City traffic, you know, India traffic is harder. Mhm. uh but it's only an issue of training on additional data sets and improving the capabilities there. Yeah. And I don't want to be unfair with this question of what happens in 20 years to earners if even if it takes 20 years because I could extrapolate the same thing for so many industries where AI will disrupt their jobs in 20 years. Yeah. It's a societal issue. Yeah. But what happens to society? What has happened to society repeatedly and repeatedly is that the workforce has adjusted over and over again, right? Every single time when um more of manufacturing was automated, there's always this drama of oh my god, what happens to the people and people figure it out and people usually then go to higher uh value types of labor and you know unemployment rate. We our world has more automation today than it ever has been and unemployment rates are at historical lows in most uh developed countries. I think the question is whether or not this is a unique time and circumstance where the change is going to happen faster than it ever has before. And based on the rate of technological change there, there's reason to believe that yeah, maybe this time may happen faster than societies historically have been able to adjust to change. Um, I don't know that yet. Uh, I don't think it's a problem for Uber. It's a problem for Well, it is a it is a potential issue for Uber and it could be a real problem. Mhm. Um but it's a big societal problem that we all have to have to take on. But there's also opportunity there. You know, how can we educate our workforce and bring to them opportunities that ultimately allow them to live the kinds of life that they that they want to? Our, you know, kind of building Uber AI solutions is one small step in that direction. But believe me, we don't have all the answers. Do you suspect Dara that you might lose access to data like you have now? If tomorrow say Elon saying that Tesla will not need Uber or even Whimo, I'm guessing a lot of the data is controlled by the hardware and less by who booked the VHO. Well, I I think that we actually now have uh we're collecting data using Lucid Cars in a bunch of uh cities as well. So, I think for Uber data is not going to be a problem. Uh and we will have data uh capture capabilities. We'll work with our partners to capture uh data as well and then provide them to our partners all over the world. And based on the growth that we see, our access to data is only going to increase. Right. Uh Travis is doing ghost kitchens. Yes. I watched a interview of his where he was speaking about how this could change how we eat. Any view on that? Do you think that's going to happen? I I think it's inevitable. Um I think it'll take time. You know, change in the real world really takes time, but I've been super impressed with what Travis has done with Ghost Kitchens and now he's working on robotics as well to automate more of the of the cooking process and bringing, you know, healthy natural food to more people with less labor. Like that's really really cool. And he's a he's a terrific partner of ours. Like we work with cloud kitchens all over the world. um they're a big partner and you know Travis is a uh is an entrepreneur that you should not underestimate. Any view on what could happen to restaurants? Dra like I know a bunch of them large chains back home who constantly complain about the 15 to 30% they end up paying uh delivery operators and they talk about how it's unsustainable. add to that you have the data and you start Dark Kitchens or what Travis is doing. What happens to an old school restaurant business? Well, I think an old school restaurant business that can't adjust is going to suffer. They're going to lose share. Mhm. And so I think it's it's a job of the old school restaurant business to become a new school restaurant business. How do you do that? Well, I I think if if you break down what restaurants do is there's a component which is food, right? Giving you great food that you enjoy. Mhm. And there's another component which is hospitality, right? Which is come to this restaurant and there's an environment that you might enjoy, etc. And there's the there's the mood, there's the romance of a of a restaurant as well. I think that what you will there are certain restaurants where the hospitality part of the offerings um is not quite as is is not as significant right it's um McDonald's is more about the food than it is about going sitting in McDonald's and enjoying you know the seating there is about the food and the brand and affordable food available quickly to so many people right and so I do think that those depending on the kind of food that you're providing. If it's about the food, then you will have to make this transition to either drive-thru or delivery because you're not adding much value in terms of hospitality. Uh, and in those kinds of circumstances, what cloud kitchens offers you, which is a more industrialized way of still providing really healthy food to someone and the hospitality there is, well, I want to eat at home. I love my home. Um, that is essentially where that system is going to go. And yes, will it take share from the classic uh from the classic restaurant business? the will, but it's also actually um extending the share of restaurant eating or restaurant food as a percentage of overall food consumption. If you look at restaurant sales, restaurant sales are growing faster than grocery sales, right? Because these restaurants are providing a better product more affordably, more conveniently. And then I do think that there will be certain restaurants where you know that hospitality that that the third place that Starbucks was so good at, I think Brian Nichols is trying to bring in the feel that part of it um is still I think going to sing, you know, the romance of going to a restaurant. And so I think that those two the utility and the romance are going to be separable. Uh, and you as a restaurant have to understand where you want to be cuz I think the middle is going to be a difficult place to to live. But the restaurant industry is adjusting. Mhm. Um, just like every single industry has to adjust. You've got to change in order to keep up with the times. So, Dra, you talk about ads on Uber. Yes. And I have found this even with myself that when I'm searching for something today, I don't use Google anymore. I end up using Perplexity or OpenAI or someone like that. Sure. Uh if I want to build a brand tomorrow and I want to market and nobody's landing on Google ads, uh what happens to the world of ads? How does a brand get built? How do I get the word out that I've started this new t-shirt company? Well, I think that those surfaces for a brand to truly get built are there in terms of Instagram and Tik Tok and and Facebook, right? So, the the Google ad world, the perplexity ad world, etc. are built for um for searches based on intent. And and so I think that that medium is about growing brands, not establishing or inventing brands. But I actually think that the surface area for brand new brands to um to to grow and thrive, it it's actually greater than that than than it ever has been. I I'll tell you a little story of of my niece. Mhm. Um Liliana. She she's incredible. She she is study humanities, loves fashion, loves golf, built um a wanted to build a new golf brand which is like fun, great, you know, fashionable clothes for for women. She she went on um uh she she used MidJourney, taught herself how to use MidJourney, designed all of the designs on MidJourney, then went out and sourced uh her clothing with uh I think it's uh some Chinese players and Indian players and I think a couple of other places uh got the clothing and now she has is building this Lily Hummer brand um and using Tik Tok and and using Instagram uh as her distribution mechanisms and also going to like these traditional golf clubs etc. She could not have done that 10 years ago. So I actually think this is a magical time with the tools that you have um at your arsenal uh and the manufacturing prowess all around the world at your disposal. It's a great time to build brands and I think the surfaces are there as long as you have a story, you've got a personality, and you have a something distinctive to add. You're saying social media is still the go-to place. Oh, yeah. Now, you know, would Liliana have the the you know, would she do well on Google? No. But that that's not the surface, you know, that's a surface, let's say, for Lululemon, not not her. U with the current president's immigration policies. Mhm. Do you think labor cost for your earners will go up significantly? The cost of labor will not go up directly. Mhm. Because I think the vast majority of drivers, couriers, etc. are legal in terms of their immigration uh status. But to some extent, we compete with the labor market in terms of the rates that uh our drivers want to make per hour. So I think in an indirect way it could have an effect on us but I don't think it'll have a direct effect on us. Right. So D I have a fund back home in India and I spent You have a fund? I have a fund. Yeah. Like a private equity fund. Sure. And I How's it doing? It's doing decent I think. I spent a lot of the last couple of years buying into the transition into electric mobility. Interesting. So we got everything from electric scooters to trucks to buses. We even did electric flying taxi investment recently. All over the world or in India specifically? Uh a little bit all over the world but more focused on that region. Have you seen Chinese electric vehicles by the way? They're incredible. Right. They are unbelievable. It is the the innovation coming out of the Chinese OEM and EV business. It It's I've never seen anything like it. It's extraordinary. Why though? Why why are they so far ahead of everyone else now? Because of the competition. I I I think that there's this um belief I I'd say from from the US and and a lot of uh of of Western countries that China is a planned economy. Okay. And China is a planned economy from a strategic standpoint. And for example, you know, they want to get into manufacturing, EVs, etc. And so while that comes top down from the government then actually the way these industries grow is every you know Chinese significant city or province etc wants their own EV uh company to succeed. So in China now there are over a hundred OEMs in China, well over a hundred. And so then there's this bottoms up competition that's based on the top down strategy that the government sets. So you have the kind of the best of both worlds, which is you have industrial policy, but then the winners aren't whose buddies with the president, right? The winners are who wins in a brutal competitive environment. So the winners, you know, coming out of China, the Gile's of the world, the BYDs, you know, the these the they have been they've been through the ringer. And so it really is survival of fittest. And the innovation that we see and the speed of development there, it's it's extraordinary. In a free market, can anyone compete in catchup? No tariffs, nothing, no duties. In a free market, can anyone catch up to to China? Of course, people can catch up. I I think that you know when you look at the Korean manufacturers there there's a ton of talent there but I think if you look at my expectation is overall share especially in the EV sector on a global basis of EVs is going to be um is going China's way for a while but individual uh innovative OEMs they're going to do fine so say I'm a scooter company in India uh I don't have the scale that Chinese manufacturers or OEMs have today. How do I compete? Cuz they're building at a 100x scale that I am. I mean, listen, it um I don't have a I don't know enough about uh the Indian industrial sector. But based on the innovation that I see out of India and the talent, there's got to be a way to compete. you know it it it's what we what I see out of India it's it's very very special I think that um especially in IT industries India really has risen um and I think manufacturing is still somewhat nent relative to the size and potential of India but there's no doubt we'll get there I had this thesis that all vehicles will be electric by x amount of time but the adoption seems to have slowed down. Why is that? Subsidies are going away. Yeah, so subsidies are going away now. I I do think that in um in Europe and China it's definitely happening. Uh I do think that it requires substantial investment over a long period of time in the infrastructure charging infrastructure of cities. Mhm. And so the societies that have continued to make way there uh you are seeing the product you're you're seeing EV penetration uh continue to improve. And within Uber, you know, um we are moving to EVs five times faster than the general public. So EVs inside of the Uber system are definitely increasing. Uh, and from my standpoint, I'm hoping that we continue to increase the penetration of EVs. And the next driver that you want switching from a combustion engine to an EV is actually Uber driver because the average Uber driver is driving four to five times the mileage of the average driver. So, we continue to push it. We're still quite committed to um moving over to as much sustainable uh both packaging for our restaurants and EVs, but I would say that it's gone much harder over the past 2 years. So, if I make the bet today by investing capital in the assumption that all vehicles will be EV, do you think it's still a fair bet? Yes, it's a better technology, but it's a question of you might want to pick where you're investing. Give me some advice. Where should I? Uh well, China, no, there's too much competition, but I I think that there's still potential in Europe. And you know, I I I look at the the the investments going into the charging infrastructure of local cities. That that's a signal that I would look for, right? With everything you're building, D uh funnily enough, I had to tell you this. There is a really popular wrestler uh in India with the name Dar Singh. Really? Yeah. I don't know if I should call you D because that's how we call it in India or D as well. Okay. With every is he is he bigger than I am? I think so. I find that surprising. I've never met him but I suspect he is. He's much bigger than me too. With everything you're building, Dra, uh is there a super app coming? Is that the eventual outcome? I think that um super apps seem to be particularly relevant in uh in in Asia and China etc. They've been quite successful there. They've had less success in western markets. So I don't know if we will get to what you would call a super app but we certainly want to be a connected family of apps. So if you if you go on Uber now, Uber Mobility, we have Uber Eats available to you and and people are are transacting billions of dollars of Uber Eats on the Uber mobility app. And on on Eats, obviously we have grocery, we have retail, you'll know next time you need a travel uh adapter. And so the the we we have I say ecosystem that is making it increasingly easier for you to work from surface to surface or with with a membership uh uh plan Uber 1 that gives you discounts on on both. So I absolutely know that we are building kind of this local ecosystem that local OS of yours. Um whether the physical manifestation is a super app or not, I don't know. Uh and my, you know, kind of the way I view it is I'm going to I'm going to let our engineers and our product folks kind of innovate, come up with the next idea and then we'll go kind of one step in front of the other to to get to that outcome. I was thinking about this and I did a little bit of research. Super apps tend to work in societies without as much rebellion in more as much what rebellion. Yes. in pseudocialist societies, in more capitalistic ones, everybody wants to bet on the new guy, the young guy. The same David Goliath argument. I mean, I think I I think there might be some of that, but there's also kind of um phone storage and capabilities. You know, having a separate app for all all these different services may uh may be a lot. And I think in some of the more developed markets, people will pay for that last 10 or 20% of finetuning that maybe a super app doesn't. So I don't know whether it's societal or it's a combination of society or technology coming together. It definitely hasn't worked in the west though. Last question. Dra, you have been a successful investment banker, a two-time CEO, Expedia, Uber, sometimes joining midway and really scaling the company. If you were me, a 20-year-old boy or girl in India and you had to start a fresh, what would you build today and who would you build it with? Who would your co-founder be? Um, so I always think people people should know their own limits. I I am not a startup person. That's not my skill. I'm a scale person, you know. I'm not the person to to kind of start with with an idea fresh. Uh, and I have enormous respect for those rebels who think that they can do it on their own. My advice would be I I've always said when when I give career advice to people is I look for three things. Um, one is I want to work for people who I like and I can learn from. Second is I want to go to a place where I as an individual can make a difference. Mhm. And third, I want to make a difference at a place that matters in the world, is making a difference in the world. Uh, and actually that's why like investment banking for me, like great people. I thought I was pretty good, but it wasn't I didn't get that jazz. I wasn't changing the world. Mhm. And so then when I saw Barry, I'm like, great, I want to work for him and we were, you know, really on this path of the changing of the world and hopefully helped it with travel as well. And and I was really, you know, I thought I was going to run for Expedia for as long as Barry would help me, but then for me Uber, the thing that really excited me was how important Uber was to the world and, you know, the difference hopefully that I could make as a as a CEO. I think a lot of young people, they kind of think too much about like how much money they're going to make or this or that. It's like work for people who you love or respect, make a difference, and try to work at a place that's making a difference, and the rest takes care of itself. Thank you, DH. This was a lot of fun, and hopefully we do it again sometime soon. I think that'd be great. Thank you. Thank you. [Music] How did you hurt your hand? Um, I was at camp uh with my kids and my son uh Hugo is a keeper and I used to be a keeper in uh uh in high school as well. So, I thought it was a good idea to to play keeper against him and all the other camp counselors. And I got carried away and I dogged to to make him proud. So I I took this one for my boy."

    "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] uh where Nik >> you told him 5 minutes >> like he has 2 minutes not >> yeah 2 minutes Everything looks good. Just the monitor, the main monitor uh went off. >> Everyone who's done can leave. >> Hi, fam. >> Hey, Nicole. >> How are you? >> I'm good. Sorry I'm late. I got caught up in getting ready for the launch tomorrow and lost track of time and excitement with the final results. But >> no worries. I'm guessing it must be really hectic, right? >> It is a very hectic day. [Music] [Music] I have the model and I've been playing with it a little bit. How is it different, Sam? I'm not an expert at this. So yeah, >> there's all these ways we can talk about, you know, it's better at this metric or it's, you know, can do this amazing coding demo that the, you know, GPT4 couldn't. But the thing that has been most striking for me is in ways that are both big and small, going back from GPT5 to our previous generation model is just so painful. It's just like worse at everything. And I've taken for granted that there is a fluency and a depth of intelligence with GPT5 that we haven't had in any previous model. Um, it's an integrated model, so you don't have to like pick in our model switcher and know if you should use GPT40 or 03 or 04 mini or any of the complicated things. It's just one thing that that works. And it is like having PhD level experts in every field available to you 24/7 for whatever you need. not only to ask anything but also to do anything for you. So if you, you know, need a piece of software created, it can kind of do it from scratch all at once. If you need a um if you need a research report on some complicated topic, it can do that for you. If you needed to, you know, plan an event for you, it could do that, too. >> Is it more agentic in nature in the sense that sequential tasking you're one step closer to it? Because I was trying that. >> It's much better at things like that. the the sort of the robustness and reliability is greatly increased and that that's very helpful for agentic workflows. So I'm like very impressed by how uh long and complex of a task it can carry out. >> So we did a call a couple of weeks ago when I was bugging you about what sectors and themes to invest in for the next decade. >> Uh so I don't want to talk about that too much. I thought we'll keep today about first principles and how the world is changing by virtue of all that is changing in the world that you dominate. So the very first thing I want to start with is if I were a 25year-old boy or girl living in Mumbai or Bangalore in India. Uh I know you've said a bunch of times that colleges are not are not holding on to the place of relevance they might have had when I was growing up. But what do I do now? A what do I study? If I'm starting a company, what kind of company do I start? Or if I were to even find a job, what industry do you think has some kind of tailwind? I'm not talking 10 years down the line, but even as close as three to five years down the line. >> First of all, uh I think this is probably the most exciting time to be starting out one's career. Uh maybe ever. I I I think like that 25-year-old in Mumbai can probably do more than any previous 25-year-old in in history could. It's really amazing what you can do with a tool like this. Uh I felt the same way when I was 25 and you know the tools then were not as amazing as tools we have now but we had the computer revolution and we could do things you know a 25-year-old then could do things that no 25-year-old in history before would have been able to and now that's happening in a huge way. So whether you want to start a company or be a programmer or go work in kind of any other industry, you know, create new media, what what whatever it is, um the ability for one person to use these tools and have great ideas and implement them with what would have taken, you know, decades of experience or teams of people is really quite remarkable. Um, in terms of particular industries, I am very excited about what AI is going to mean for science and the amount of science that one person will be able to discover and the rate at which they can do that. Clearly, it's transforming what it means to program computers in a huge way and people will be able to create completely new kinds of software in a at huge new new scale. Uh definitely for startups, you know, if you have that idea for a new business, the ability for a very tiny team to do a huge amount of work is is great. Um but it feels like this is just now a very open canvas. You know, people people are limited to a degree that they've never been before only by the quality and creativity of their ideas and you have these incredible tools to help you realize them. >> Is there anything in particular you want to say about GPD5? then I can ask you questions around that. >> GPT5 does does feel to us like it's going to be another big step forward in how people uh use these systems. Um the the level of capability, the level of robustness, the reliability and the ability to use this just for a lot of tasks in life to create software, to answer questions, to learn to work more efficiently. like this is a this is a you know pretty significant step forward. Each time we've had one of these we have been amazed by the human potential it unlocks. Uh and in particular India is India is now our second largest market in the world. Um it may become our largest. We've taken a lot of feedback from users in India about what they'd like from us. better support for languages, more affordable access, uh much more and we've been able to put that into this model and upgrades to Chat GPT. Um so we're committed to continuing to work on that. But the, you know, every time we've had a major leap forward in how the capability we can bring to users, um we've been amazed by what those those 25-year-olds go off and do in terms of creating new companies or, you know, learning better, getting better medical advice or whatever else. Is there anything that I could build on top of GPT5 today as a 25-year-old in India that you think are lowhanging fruits per se that I should definitely look at? >> I think you could build an entire startup way more efficiently than you ever could before. Now, this is obviously I'm biased because this is like near and dear to my heart, but the fact that as a 25-year-old in India or anywhere else, maybe with a couple of friends, maybe just by yourself, you could use GPT5 to uh help you write the software for a product much more efficiently, help you uh handle customer support, help you write marketing and communications plans, um help you review legal documents, all of these things that would have taken a lot of people and a lot of expertise and you now have GPT5 to help you do all all of this. That that's pretty amazing. If I could push you to be like a bit more specific and say I get science but uh what do I study? Say I've been studying engineering or commerce or arts or something like that. Is there any specific thing I study in order to use AI to develop something in science? >> I think the most important specific thing to study is just getting really good at using the new AI tools. Um I think learning is valuable for its own sake and learning to learn is this like meta skill that will will serve you throughout life and whether you're learning you know engineering like computer engineering or biology or any other field like that if you get good at learning things you can learn new things quickly but fluency with the tools um is you know is really important. when I was in college or in high school that it seemed to me that the obvious thing to do was learn to program. And I didn't know exactly what I was going to use that for, but there was this new frontier that seemed very high leverage and important to get good at. And right now, learning how to use AI tools is probably the most important specific hard skill to learn. And the difference between people who are really good at really AI native and think of everything in terms of those tools and don't is huge. There's other general skills. Um, learning kind of like to be adaptable and resilient, which I think is something really learnable. Uh, that that's like quite valuable in a world that's changing so fast. Learning how to figure out what people want um is is really quite important. The the before this, I used to be a startup investor and people would ask me what the most important thing for startup founders to figure out was. Um my predecessor Paul Graham had this answer that has always stuck with me for people and it to give to founders and it it became the motto for Y cominator which is make something people want and that sounds like such an easy instruction. I have watched so many people try so hard to learn how to figure that out uh and fail and then I've watched many people work really hard to learn how to do that and get great at it over a career. So, uh, that's something as well. But, you know, in terms of the specifics, like are you supposed to take the biology class or the physics class, I don't think it matters right now. >> And if I were to build on top of that, and when you say learn to adapt and change and learn AI tools faster, is there a path? I'm just looking for a light that somebody could begin walking towards. How does one get better at the AI tools that are available out there? Well, one great thing to do, uh, GPT5 is quite good at helping to create small pieces of software very quickly and, uh, much better than any model that I've used. And in the last few weeks, uh, I have surprised myself how much I've used it to create a piece of software to solve some little problem that I have in my life. And, you know, it's been an interesting creative process cuz I'll ask it for a first draft. I'll start using that and then I'll say hey with this feature it would be better or with this other thing I'd be able to do something differently um or you know I have started using it and realized that with my workflow I really needed this and by putting more and more of the things that I have to do in this kind of a workflow uh that's been a very interesting way for me to learn how to use this. You mentioned Paul Graham and I I was reading this letter or report he wrote in 2009 where he spoke about five founders to watch out for and I think you were 19 at the time and he mentioned you along with people like Steve Jobs and Larry and Sergey. Uh why was that? You hadn't accomplished anything of note like they had. What did Paul see you see in you? And what do you think is the innate skill set that sets you apart from your peers? >> That was very nice of him. I remember that. Uh I I certainly I remember at the time feeling that it was very deeply undeserved, but uh grateful that he he said that. Um I mean there's like a lot of people who are starting great companies. We we got lucky here in many ways. We've also worked super hard. uh may maybe the one thing that I would that I think we have done here well is to take a very long time horizon and think very independently. You know when we started it was it was like 4 and a half years before we had a first product and it was very uncertain. We were just doing research trying to figure out how to get AI to work and we had very different ideas than the rest of of the world. Um, but I think that ability to sort of trust our own conviction over a long time horizon without a lot of external feedback was was very helpful. >> Is that a V or a I thing? Cuz I'm speaking about when you were 19. >> Oh, um, sorry, I thought you were asking about OpenAI. Uh, me when I was 19, I barely remember that. I don't know. I was like a I was like a naive 19-year-old that didn't really know what he was doing. And uh this is not false modesty. My my own self I think I've done impressive things now. But my own self-conception in 19 was like deeply unure of myself and very unimpressive. >> If the world were to be the world of tomorrow were to be a AI kingdom of sorts, you're definitely some kind of prince. And uh I don't know if you follow Makavei uh but he used to say a very interesting thing. He said that a prince should always appear appear but not be religious, compassionate, trustworthy, humane and honest. Uh, do you think this particular projection of I've heard you I've watched a lot of your interviews of late and I've heard you say repeatedly that you're not formidable and use words like that. Uh, this projection of humility, is it apt for the world we live in or the world you're walking into? >> I'm not sure it's apt for either one. But uh when I when I was 19, to go back to what you said, I I assumed that the people running these big tech companies really had it all figured out and there were, you know, adults in the room and somebody had a plan and there were these people that were like way different than me that understood how to do things and, you know, had this like the companies were like running very well and there was like not much drama and everything was like, you know, just everything was everything was being handled by the adults. Um, and now that I'm supposed to be the adult in the room, I will tell you I think no one has a plan. No one really has it all working smoothly. Everyone, or at least I am figuring out as they go. And you know, you have things you want to build and then things go wrong and you bet on the wrong people or the right people and you know, you get a technological breakthrough here or you don't there. And you just keep putting one foot in front of another and you put your head down and work and you you know, you have these like tactics that some of them become great strategies, some of them don't. uh you try something and the market reacts in some way or your competitors react in some way and you do something else and and the and now my conception is everybody is kind of figuring it out as they go. Everybody is like learning on the job and um I don't think that's like false humility. I think that's just the way the world works and it's like a little it's a little strange to be on this side of it but that is what it seems like. >> Uh I'm not even speaking so much about the authenticity of the humility or not but more again from the lens of somebody starting to build for tomorrow because that's who we speak to. Is that a good image to project into the world? Does it the image of humility really work today? >> You mean should someone project that image? >> Yeah. >> Uh I mean I certainly have a very negative reaction to people who are projecting certainty and confidence when uh they don't really know what's going to happen. And the reason is not just because it's annoying, which it is, but also because I think if you have that kind of a mindset, it is harder to have the culture of intellectual openness and to sort of like listen to other viewpoints and make good decisions. Um, a thing I say all the time to people is no one knows what happens next. And the more you forget that and the more you're like, I am smarter than everybody else. I have a master plan. I'm not going to pay attention to like what my users are saying or where the technology takes us or how the world is reacting, but you know, I know better and the world doesn't know as much. I think you just make worse decisions. So, having that kind of open mindset um and the sort of like curiosity and willingness to adapt to new data and change your mind, I think that's super important. Like the number of times we have thought we knew something to get smacked in the face by reality here has been a lot and one of our strengths as a company is when that happens we change what we're going to do where that that's been I think that's been really great and a big part of what's helped us succeed. So, so maybe there are other ways to succeed and maybe, you know, projecting a ton of bravado into the world works, but the best founders that I have watched up close throughout my career have all been more like the sort of quick learning and adapting style. >> And you probably know more about this than most because of your role at Y Combinator. >> I have a lot of data points on it at least. Yeah. Yeah. Uh when we met in Washington a couple of days a couple of years ago at the White House, I remember when we were speaking and you went somewhere, I was speaking to your partner and you guys had a kid. >> We did. >> And how is that? >> Uh it is my favorite thing ever. But I mean I I know that like I have nothing that is not a cliche to say here. Um, but it is the coolest, most amazing, most like emotionally overwhelming in the best ways and hard ways to uh experience every everything said about how great it is, how intense it is, how it's like a kind of love you didn't know you could feel. It's all it's all true. I have nothing to add other than I strongly recommend it and I think uh it's been really wonderful. It's amazing. So I ponder on this a lot Sam uh kids, why people have kids and also questions like what happens to religion and marriage tomorrow? Can I ask you why you had a kid? like family has always been an incredibly important thing to me and going like it just it felt like it felt like the most and I didn't even know how much I underestimated what it was actually going to be like but it felt like the most important and meaningful and fulfilling thing I could imagine doing and it has so far so early uh exceeded all expectations. Do you think it's the biological need to procreate? >> I don't know. There's like this seems like a thing that is so deep it's difficult to put into words. But I feel confident like everyone I know uh looking back on their life who has had a great career and had a family has either said, you know, I'm so glad I took the time to have kids. that was one of the most important things I've ever done, the best things I've ever done. Or they've said that was by far the best thing I've ever done. That was way more important than any of the work I ever did. And uh I was like willing to take the leap of faith that that would be true for me, too. And it certainly seems like it will be. It's like I Yeah, it it is. And if it is just a biological hack, I don't care. I'm so happy. Um, but it, you know, it like there's a sense of responsibility and kind of like family is the word that keeps coming to mind that, uh, it's just really great. >> The world seems to be having lesser kids. And do you have an insight into the future of marriage, religion, and kids? Yeah, I hope that creating family, creating community, uh, whatever you want to call it, will become far more important in a sort of post AGI world. Um, I think it's a real problem for society that those things have been in retreat. Um, I think that that just feels strictly bad to me. Uh I have I don't I'm obviously not sure why that's been happening, but I hope we'll really reverse course on that. And in a world where people have more abundance, more time, more sort of resources and potential and ability, uh I think it's like pretty clear that family and community are two of the things that make us the happiest. And I hope we will turn back to that. >> As societies get more affluent, if one were to buy into the mimemetic desires of people, we all tend to want what other people want, not necessarily what other people have. If we all had more, do you think we would still want more if we all had enough? I I do sort of think that human demand, desire, ability to play status games, whatever is is like it seems pretty limitless. Um I don't think that's necessarily bad. Uh or not all bad. Um but yeah, I think we will figure out new things to want and new things to compete over. Do you think the world retains largely the world retains the current model of capitalism and democracy in a way? Let me give you a scenario. What happens if a company X let's say open AI gets to the point where it is 50% of world GDP. Does society allow for that or >> I would bet not. I don't think that will happen. I think this will be a much more distributed thing. But if for some reason that did happen, I think society would say, \"We don't think so.\" Like, \"Let's figure out let's figure out something to do here.\" Um, my my the analogy I like most for AI is the transistor, which was this really important scientific discovery that for a while looked like it was going to capture a ton of the value and then turned out to be something that just gets built into like tons of products and services. And you don't really think about, you know, the fact that you're using transistors all day long. It's just kind of in everything and all these companies make incredible products and profits from it in this very distributed way. Um, so I I would guess that's what happens and it's not like one company is ever half of global GDP. I at one point I did worry that that might happen, but I think that was a naive take, right? But do you think the odds of the world moving towards socialism go up or if something gets that that large, will it get nationalized and we become more socialist? >> I don't know if something will get nationalized. I don't know if the world will like officially turn towards socialism, but I expect that I expect that like social support or redistribution or whatever you want to call it will increase over time as society gets richer and as sort of the technological landscape shifts. I don't know what way it's going to happen and I expect in different countries it'll happen in different ways like uh I think you'll see experimentation of like new kinds of sovereign wealth funds new kinds of like universal basic income ideas redistribution of AI compute I don't know exactly what but I I suspect we'll see a lot of experimentation in society here >> on universal basic income I think worldcoin was a very interesting experiment can you tell us a bit about what's happening there >> uh the idea was could we you know we have all this AI coming. We really want to like care about humans as special. Can we find a way to a privacy preserving way to identify unique humans and then create a new network and a new currency around that? Uh so it's a very interesting experiment still early but growing quite fast. If AGI eliminates scarcity or scarcity by virtue of increasing productivity, could one also assume that it would be deflationary in nature? Uh capital or money loses its ability to return a rate of return and capital no longer remains a moat in the world of tomorrow. I feel confused about this. Uh I think if you like look at the basic economic principles, it's supposed to be hugely deflationary. Um and yet if the world decides that, you know, building out AI compute today is super important to things tomorrow. Um maybe something very strange happens with the economy and maybe capital is really really important because every piece of compute is is so valuable. Um I was asking someone at dinner the other night if they thought that uh interest rates should be minus 2% or 25%. And he kind of laughed. He's like well that's a ridiculous question. It has to be. And then he stopped and said actually I'm not sure. So, I think it's like, yeah, it should be deflationary eventually, but I could see it being weird in the short term. >> That's actually a very interesting thing to say. Do you suspect it would be minus 2%. >> Uh, eventually, >> right, but I'm not sure. And maybe it's just like we're in this massive expansionary time where you're trying to like build the Dyson sphere in the solar system and you're borrowing money at crazy rates to do that. And then there's more expansion beyond and more and more and I I don't know like I find it very hard to see more than a few years in the future at this point. >> The conversation we were having a couple of weeks ago u I was doing more research on the sectors you had suggested. Uh I think we agreed on older and sicker world. Uh you also made a case for as discretionary spend goes up, gateway luxury brands might do well. >> Yeah. >> What happens to them in a deflationary world? Cuz the value of these purchases go down. >> Maybe not. I mean deflationary world some things can face huge deflationary pressure and others can be the sink for all of the extra capital. So I'm actually not sure they do go down in a deflationary world. You know, >> I would bet they go up actually. >> Yeah, >> I think so. Uh because the extra the excess capital has to flow somewhere. >> When you look at classical economic theory like a Adam Smith and stuff like that, uh the Austrian school always spoke about the marginal utility of things. Uh if you have one kettle at home to make tea, it has X in value. When you have two kettles, it still has some value. But when you have 20 kettles, it has no value. Do you think the world goes in that direction? >> Yeah. So, 20 kettles doesn't help you. Uh but even if you're only going to, you know, spend 2 hours a day playing video games or whatever, and that amount of time is fixed, and so you don't need 20 hours worth of video games. If that two hours of games gets better and more entertaining forever and ever and ever and just keeps getting more and more compelling, that still has value to you. And and I think there are a lot of categories where um we will find that people can just get much better stuff even if they don't necessarily get more of them. I think we'll see this in a really big way. >> Do you think there's a use case for the rappers that are getting built on these large models right now? Like I was in uh the US recently and I met Harvey for example. What happens to a rapper like that does it get innovated out by the model itself at some point of time? >> Some of them yes and some of them no. Um and it's you know it's like sometimes you can obviously predict when one is going to go one way or the other and sometimes it really depends on the choices the the company makes down uh down the line. the the the main thing I would say is using AI itself does not create a defensible business. You see this with every technology boom where people are like, well, I'm a startup doing X and because I'm using the latest technology trend, the normal rules of business don't apply to me. And that's never true. You've always you've always got to you've always got to like parlay that advantage that comes from using the new technology into a durable business with real value that gets created. And it's kind of a race against the clock to do that. So, you know, uh you can definitely build an amazing thing with AI, but then you have to go build a a real defensible layer around it. If I were to build a business on top of your model, let me give you the example of Amazon for example. If I sold a certain kind of t-shirt and I sold a lot and Amazon had all the data, eventually Amazon probably started a white labeled brand which was very similar to mine and cannibalized my business almost. Should one worry that will happen here as well because you're no longer just a model but you're foring into so many different businesses. >> I I I would come back to that example of the transistor the you know we we are building this general purpose technology that you can integrate into something in a lot of ways. Um but we keep following our equivalent of Moore's law and the the general capability keeps going up. If you build a business that gets better, the business gets better when when the model gets better, then you should keep doing you should keep doing well if we continue to make progress. If you build a business where when the model gets better, your business gets worse because the wrapper was too thin or whatever, then that's probably bad in the same way that it's been bad in other technology revolutions. So, there are clearly companies building on top of AI models that are creating huge value and very deep relationships with their customers for themselves. Um, Curser is like a recent example of a company that is just exploding in popularity and I think really durable relationships with their with their customers. And then there's many others that don't and and that's kind of that's always the case. Uh, it does seem to me like there are more companies getting created now than in previous technological revolutions that feel like they have a chance at real durability. Um, maybe an example we could use to ground this is when the um when the iPhone first came out and the App Store first came out, the first set of apps were pretty light and a lot of them ended up being features that kind of made it into future versions of iOS. You know, you could like sell a flashlight for a dollar that turned on the flash on your on your phone. And you made a lot of dollars doing that, but it wasn't sticky cuz eventually Apple just added that into the operating system where it belonged. But if you started something that was like complicated and the iPhone was just an enabler for it, like Uber, that was a very valuable long-term thing to do. And in the early days, like the GBT3 days, I think you had a lot of kind of toy applications, as you should. Um, many of which didn't need to be standalone companies or products. But now, as the markets matured, you're really seeing some of these more durable businesses form. So if you lay emphasis on owning the customer almost like the interface with the customer, would you say the relationship gets deeper when I sell a service on top of your model versus a product? Cuz if it's a product company, the the exchange happens once. But if it's a service company, it happens repeatedly and there is room for me to build in taste in that transaction which is repetitive in nature. Yeah, gen generally I agree with that. >> A small part of my world or a part of my world is creating content which I do once a month. If a model to a large extent is able to factor in my vintage, my tenure and my evolution and uh throw out an output which is predictive in nature with a fair degree of fair degree of uh efficiency. Now if I behave in the same predictable manner tomorrow will be less valuable than me being contrarian. contrarian not to the world but contrarian to my own behavior almost. So do you think the world inordinately favors contrarian behavior tomorrow? >> Yeah, that that that's a good point. I think so. I think uh the thing I'm thinking is how much will the models learn to do that? You you know you want to be contrarian and right. Most of the time you're contrarian and you're contrarian and wrong and that's not that helpful. But but yeah, I bet the ability to come up with the kind of contrarian right idea that the models today just can't do at all and maybe they'll get better at at some point. Um that value of that should go up over time. Getting good at doing things models can't do seems like an obvious increase in value. >> Outside of being contrary, is there anything else that I could do that a model will take longer to learn? Look, the models are going to be much smarter than we are, but there's a lot of things that people care about that have nothing to do with intelligence. Um, maybe maybe there can be like an AI podcast host that is much better than you at asking interesting questions and, you know, kind of engaging whatever. And I personally don't think that podcast host, that AI podcast host is likely to be more popular than you. People really care about other humans. This is like very deep. People want to know a little bit about your life story, what got you here. They want to be able to like talk to other people about this like shared sense of who you are. And there's like some cultural and social value in that. We are obsessed with other people. Um and >> why why is that Sam? Why do you think that is >> that you know like I think that's also like deep in in our biology. Um and uh you know again earlier comment you don't fight things that are deep in biology. Uh, I mean, I can I think it make ton of sense of why we we would evolve that way, but you know, here we are. So, you know, we're going to keep caring about real people and even if the AI podcast host is much smarter than you, I think it's very unlikely he'll be more popular than you. >> So, in a perverse way, being stupider will be more novel than being smart. I don't know if it's like uh stupider or smarter that has the novelty, but I think being a real person in a world of unlimited AI content will increase in value. >> Is a real person somebody who screws up unlike a model. >> I mean certainly real people do screw up. So maybe that's part of what we associate with a real person. I'm not sure. But I do think we we just knowing that it's a real person or not, we really extremely care about. What is the difference between AGI and human intelligence today and tomorrow? >> So, so like with GPT5, you have something that is incredibly smart in a lot of domains at tasks that take, you know, seconds to a few minutes. It's very superhuman at knowledge, at pattern recognition, at recall on these shorter term tasks. But in terms of figuring out what questions to ask or to work on something over a very long period of time, uh we are definitely not close to human performance. And an interesting example that one of our researchers gave me recently is if you look at our performance in math um you know a couple of years ago we could solve math problems that would take like an expert human a few minutes to solve. Recently we got gold level performance on the international math olympiad. Each of those problems takes about an hour and a half. So we've gone from a problem a thinking horizon of a few minutes to an hour and a half. Uh to prove a new an important new mathematical theorem maybe takes like a thousand hours and you can predict when we can do a thousand hour problem but certainly in the world today we cannot at all and so that that's like another dimension where AI can't do it. So I was in the US between SF between San Francisco and New York the last couple of months and I met a whole bunch of AI founders. Uh the one thing everybody seemed to agree on is like for AI the US is a few years ahead of most others. They also thought that for robotics China seems to be ahead. Uh do you have a view on robotics and what happens there like humanoid or other form of robotics? >> I think it will be incredibly important in a couple of years. I think uh one of the things that is going to feel most AGI like is seeing robots just walk by you on the street doing kind of normal day-to-day tasks. Um >> is there a reason why they need to have humanlike form? Well, you can certainly have non-humanoid forms, but the world is really built for humans, you know, like door handles, steering wheels and cars, factories, like a lot of this is built for we we've built it for our own kind of morphology. So, there will of course be other specialized robots too, but um the world like is built and I hope stays built for for for us. So, you know, robots that match that form factor. It seems like a good idea. >> If I'm a young guy looking to start a robotics company, but somebody else has manufacturing scale and I really want as a Indian guy to be able to build and compete there. How do I make up for manufacturing scale as someone starting up? >> Well, eventually once you build enough robots, they can make more copies of themselves. And uh but in the short term I think you probably have to find some really good partners that know a lot about manufacturing and you know we're we're interested in robots so we're thinking about this and it's definitely uh it's definitely a new skill for us to learn. >> Sam, what happens to the form factor? I've been using the cell phone for a long time. I know you will not likely speak about what you're doing with Johnny IV and what happens there or maybe you will but what happens to form factor overall? I one one of the things that I think we'll be defining about the difference of AI versus the sort of previous way we've been using computers and technology is you really want AI to be have as much context as possible do stuff for you and be proactive. So, a computer or a phone, you know, it's kind of either on or off. It's in your pocket or it's in your hand and you're using it. But you might want AI to just be, you know, like a companion with you throughout your day and alerting you in different ways when it can do something to help you or when it's, you know, there's something really important you need to know or reminding you of something that you said you needed to do earlier in the day. And the current form factors of computers are I think not quite right for that. They do have this either on or off binary. Uh that I think isn't quite what we want for like a the sort of sci-fi dream of the AI companion. So the form factor that enables that you could imagine a lot of things. Um there's people talking about you know glasses and wearables and little you know things that sit on your table and uh I think the world will experiment with a lot of those. But this idea of sort of ambiently aware physical hardware that feels like it's going to be important. >> Is that the form factor with Johnny Ive like a sensor? >> Uh so we'll try multiple products. Uh but but I think this idea of trying to build hardware that an AI companion can sort of embody itself in will be an important thread. >> Right. The the last two things I want to ask you Sam is one about fusion because I know you've invested in helion and you're a big proponent of it. >> Does that solve the climate change problem? Would you put money on that? >> Well, it certainly helps a lot. I I suspect that we've already done sufficient damage to the climate. We're going to have to undo some damage, too, even if we got to switch to fusion right away. But it would certainly be a great step forward. And the last question I have for you Sam is the question I care most about. What's in this AI realm for India as a country? What's the opportunity for us? >> As I mentioned earlier, I think India may be our largest market in the world uh at some point in the not very distant future. the excitement, the embrace of AI in India and the ability to for Indian people to use AI to just sort of leaprog into the future and uh invent a totally new and better way of doing things and the sort of the economic benefits that come from that the societal benefits if if there is one large society in the world that seems most enthusiastic to transform with AI right now it's India and the energy is incredible I'm looking forward to coming soon Um, and it's really like quite amazing to watch. Uh, and I I think the it's sort of the momentum is unmatched anywhere in the world. >> I I feel like the question really is how do we transition from being from being a consumer to be a producer where we can build something that other people use outside of India. >> That that was what I I mean there's lots of things happening there. Good. But that that was the thing I meant. I think that's really happening already in a big way. Um the the entrepreneurial energy around building with AI in India is is quite amazing and we hope to see much more of it. >> Right. Yeah. Super. Thank you Sam for doing this. >> Thank you for having me. >> Thank you. >> Appreciate it. >> I'm going to message you. >> Okay. Good to see you. Thanks for doing this."

    "transcript": "[Music] Yucky [Music] [Music] [Music] I remember reading this thing about Google offering you $100 million not to quit. Not today, but 15 years ago, which was a lot of money. What is it? I like that you're waiting for the question and not reacting. I want to see where you're going to take this. We started over. It's rolling. Okay. Can you define Neil Waves? What do you think it is? Cuz I've tried and I'm I'm kind of like conflicted. I don't know if the messaging has gone out in the manner that it should. But what is Waves really? Um well my understanding is it's really the first time ever I think not just here in India but really anywhere in the world where there's been such a um kind of meeting of everybody who has an interest and a stake in the creative industries uh with really the purpose of um finding ways to accelerate it further certainly for India and Indian culture and Indian creators. Um but I really think that it will have a global impact as a result. Um and I think you know kind of the the insight for me at least um was that the recognition you know certainly on part of of the government but I think uh the creative industries in India in general the recognition that um you know India really is at the cusp of being a true creator nation and I get to see it from my vantage point at at YouTube. Um I see it in the numbers. I see it obviously in everybody that I interact with whenever I'm visiting India. But I think um that's the big vision. And I think what's really interesting about it is it's it's a mix of everything. There's obviously the cultural and creative aspect of it, but there's also the business aspect of it. What's required to be a successful creator? There's also the collaborative aspect of it. There's the private government partnership aspect. And I think Waves, at least in my understanding, is trying to put all those pieces together. Content creators and politics. Do you think they're more they're getting more ingrained than they have ever been? Um, well, the way I think about it is Did you vote Republican or Democrat? Did I I'm not going to get into all all my pieces. I've been I've I've voted on both sides for a very long time. Let's put it let's put it that way. You're asking so you're not asking an India question. You're asking in general. I would say um it really goes back to the fact that um you know a place like YouTube is uh yes it's a place for content creators and creators and YouTubers and most of what we all consume on on YouTube is is entertainment or learning or what have you. But really, it's a it's an information platform. And our mission statement is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. And so, if you think about that, what happens on YouTube is a reflection of what's happening in the world. And vice versa. And so the connection therefore between creativity on YouTube and politics or elections or societal conversations um in if you look at it in that context shouldn't be a surprise and that's what we see in the US whether you're talking about you know the Republican party or the Democratic party um and it's what we saw here in the elections the gigantic elections that happened here in in India last year and you know just happened in Canada yesterday and really all over the world. So, if I were to make the assumption that Trump utilized content creators better in the previous election, does the platform that houses most of the content creators get to sway what should be heard since you control the narrative? Uh, not the narrative, but who watches which narrative. Yeah, I really don't look at it that way at all. In fact, um I really think that it goes back to what I was saying, which is YouTube really is a reflection of of what is happening in the world. And precisely, it's actually meant to be a reflection of what's interesting to you in the moment. When you open up the YouTube app, it really should be a reflection of Nikil's interests of the moment over some period of time. Uh doesn't mean that it's just that. There's obviously we endeavor to show a diversity of content, but it's generally oriented around what we know to be of your personal interest based on your viewing habits, etc. So, you as the user really are in the driver's seat in terms of what type of content you're looking for, what you're looking to view, and it's the job of the content creators to be true to who they are, but then to use the YouTube platform to build an audience. And I say that, you know, YouTube in many ways is the the the the most efficient way of connecting a creator like yourself with their audience wherever they are in the world. But it's it's really just that you are the one responsible for actually producing the content that's interesting to people and I as a fan of yours um am only going to watch it to the extent that I'm interested. And so that's fundamentally what happens on YouTube. In your question about what happened in the recent elections in the US, um I do think that um uh news commentators, podcasters or who whatever you want to call them play played a played a big role in that election. And I do think that candidates that um got the word out as a result of engagement in what you know in generations past or years past would have been overlooked as an outlet. um ended up being successful because those podcasters had large audiences that were interested in what their guests had to say and um we saw that play out over and over. Um you know I always say that the success of podcasts on YouTube it came into focus last year. You know, obviously the elections were were kind of a pivotal point in the US, but it was like an overnight success many years in the making because when we first started investing in in podcasts, um, and I'm curious what your experiences uh on our platform, we made like two or three really big bets that I think back then would have been kind of strange. Well, the biggest is we bet on the fact that people would want to watch a conversation, not listen to it. Lots of people listen to podcasts on YouTube, but lots of people watch it. And obviously COVID was an accelerator when people were at homes, they wanted to see what was happening. But um there's an enormous amount of content, podcast content that's viewed uh not just on mobile phones, but on television screens. So that was one. The second was really betting on discovery. So discovery around not just podcasts that you're subscribed to, but like discovery around podcasts that you might be genuinely interested in. So that was a that was a really big part of it. So posting the podcast and and going about it that way. And then the third piece is just recognizing that um it's not just about building an audience for podcasters, it's also helping them monetize it. So really making it so that podcasts were integrated into our YouTube partner program monetization. So those three bets really ended up being I think kind of foundational driver of our of our podcast strategy. So when I think of podcasting Neil uh news has there is no information arbitrage when somebody is reporting the news for a long time the bias of the reporter is why I might have watched one particular news channel over another. I feel recently people have gotten disillusioned by corporations owning news channels and assume the newscasters views will also be biased and a podcaster seems to be more of a independent character so the bias of the corporation doesn't translate onto him. Do you think why people are moving to podcast in the news information space? Um yeah, that's really interesting and I think um first I would say I think there's lots of reasons why why um podcasters have moved to platforms like YouTube but also found success on it. But I think two comes down to two fundamental things. Um, one is they would only do it if they felt that they could build an audience on YouTube. So that there was no barrier between them and the audience that they were looking to build. No, my question is more why is the audience choosing to know what happened in the world from a podcaster versus a news media channel? Uh, I have to, you know, I'd say that I don't think it's an eitheror. So I would say and again just speaking from a what's happening on YouTube standpoint, we see lots of success from what you would call traditional news channels. Um they have adopted the YouTube style of content. Uh many of them have been investing in the platform for a very long time. And I don't mean just clips. I mean like full-on live news broadcasts, um replays of the broadcast, live streams in many cases. So really kind of all the gamut of news and we have seen um their success on our platform as well especially when people are coming to YouTube looking for information around politics um to use your example but you know whatever sort of thing impacts their lives we've seen that success now I think what a podcaster does sort of to the extent that they're related to news is that they cover the news talk about the news but they also are doing it um through the means and the tools of a creator right like so you know YouTube often times is about connecting with the person whose channel it is like it's not just about what they said in that one particular video I as a fan am interested in that person in general like how do they go about their day what their interests are etc and so I think the nice thing about podcasting on YouTube is it really combines both of those things if I were to push you a at Neil and ask you a binary answer to the question. 5 years from today, will you be watching Fox or CNN to know what happened in the world that day or would you be watching a independent creator on YouTube say what it is? I really don't think it's going to be one or the other. Fox um had one of its most successful quarters months ever on YouTube. Just I think just last month they reported it themselves. they've been investing and credit to them, right? They've been investing heavily in understanding uh this um uh but I also think alongside of that you're going to see other types of content like you said podcasters be successful and I think some of that gets at sort of the inherent nature of YouTube which is it really can be all of these things. I mean two billion people come to the platform every single day. um the subset of them that are consuming news, there's going to be such enormous diversity in terms of their preferences, their priorities in terms of how they consume news on YouTube. So, I just think that 5 years from now, you should expect to see more of that diversity, not less. I think if I were predicting anything, I don't think it would be a one or zero between those two types of options. I could very well see a third type of format get invented and find success on the platform. That's what's amazing about about the creators on on YouTube is you never really know what they're going to experiment with and then come up with next. I know it's tough to put YouTube in a box, but if you were to try and define what YouTube is today, what would you say it is? Um um that's a great question. I would say um I I think we are we are really our own thing. And and what I uh what I mean by that is our ambition is to be a a a streaming service where you can watch, create, and share video regardless of where you are in the world, who you are. Um and that's our goal. That's our mission. And what I like about that is it really encapsulates everything from living room screens to television screens to um you know your phone in your pocket uh to you know car radio all that sort of stuff. We're not social media. We're not a place where you go to connect or share with your friends. You're primarily there to watch video. Um and we're not sort of linear traditional television either. Um, we're sort of our own thing because of the nature of the content that's created on our platform. Being a creator-led content generation platform, are you more a place where content is stored and then streamed? Do you think the technology of doing that defines YouTube more? Or are you a curator of content which shows me what I want to see more? Um, I think the term create curator is a is a bit of a loaded term and because we don't curate the content. We've tried in in the past. We had something called YouTube originals. It wasn't successful. So, we don't do that. what we do. I the the analogy that I use that I think I think sort of works best is most of the people at YouTube uh are software engineers or technologists and our job is to build the stage and I want that to be the best possible stage in the world. When you come to the stage to this theater, the most comfortable seats, the best view lines, the most amazing, you know, effects or what have you. Um but that's it. That's what we do. The people that are on the stage are our creators. And so we have to create the tools and capabilities that make them shine the best possible stage and make viewers really want to keep coming back to that theater. And I think that's the best really the best way to describe uh what YouTube is and and what YouTube does. So build the technology and then frankly get out of the way. So, is YouTube the show director which picks which show goes on at what time? Or are you somebody who built the theater? We are really someone who built the theater, right? We don't um I don't tell you when to post or what you should say. You have exercised that creative control. Well, back to your point on podcasters. I multiple podcasters will tell me that they have they've had more creative and editorial control by taking their destiny into their own hands than they ever had in sort of any other uh type of their profession in the past. And that's what YouTube is. You get to decide those things. What I need to do for you is to give you the technology that allows you to match with your audience. not just you know the person who subscribes to your channel um but you know who but who might be who who else might be interested in it um you know you produce um content and have conversations that might be interesting to an English listener somebody who understands English but of course this conversation might uh apply to somebody speaking Spanish or Portuguese or Tamil or Bengali and so I should provide you the technology so you choose if you choose choose to have to allow for this conversation to happen in all those languages as an example. So that's what I mean by like we build the theater, we kind of build the rooms in the theater, we build the stage, we build the seats, but you're the one who's on the stage. So Neil, I'm 38 years old. Uh I have grown up in India largely in Bangalore. So my relationship with content went from watching Hindi TV serals growing up on TV on traditional broadcast TV uh to cricket and then maybe getting my first personal device or a medium to consume content when I was 16 or 17 years old. uh to where I sit today and you know the movie theatergoing experience all of that followed where I sit today I'm trying to predict where nikil the 48-year-old will be what content will he be consuming on what medium uh can you throw some light on that yeah I would say a few things might be different in 10 years first I would say that everything we've talked out. Uh I still think that we're in the early innings of um meaning that the growth of content in general, but uh you know, YouTube content is going to only continue to grow on screens like the living room. We're just getting started there. I would say that probably the biggest early stage sort of phenomenon that I see that I'm very excited about and actually a lot of it is being driven by what's happening here in India is just this whole idea of like creator-led content production. So it's like you know creators are the startups of Hollywood and I mean Hollywood I mean Bollywood I mean kind of just whatever pick your metaphor there uh and just like startups keep an industry vibrant just like in Silicon Valley creators do the same thing um when it comes to the production of content so in 10 years this relatively new phenomenon which you know I'm cons consider at least for young people is pretty mainstream but I think for the general population it's not quite quite there yet. I think is going to be pretty mainstream. You know, when I go visit um uh Burbank in California, right down the street from the largest studio in the world, 100-year-old studio, Disney, uh there are all of these startup studios led by creators like Rhett and Link, Alan Chicken Chow, etc. 10,000 square foot studios where they're producing amazing content. It's done differently. It's done in a very YouTube style. it's done with their personalities, but they're doing, you know, kind of roughly what big studios were doing before. They're just doing it on a different sort of scale, different budgets, etc. So, I think that's going to be a really big phenomenon. I think the other one that's very exciting is um you know, the advent of AI and what AI will be able to do for creativity. My view is that it's really going to be a tool that enhances human creativity, never replacing it. We can talk more about that. I think again, you know, you gave the example from sort of you growing up and sort of how these various things sort of came into play for you. I think if you think about it through the lens of young people today, the things that they take for granted um were things that and I'm a little bit older than you, so I had to discover this even even later in my life. They just they just have been having that experience from from day one. And so I think you know one of the things that um people shouldn't forget when it comes to the content world is like ultimately consumers really are in charge. They really vote with their time and their engagement. And today a young person um uh almost expects all of their favorite content to really be in one place. Everything from a 15-second short to a 15 minute vlog to an hourong podcast, 15 hour gaming live stream and 4-hour NFL game, you know, three-hour cricket game. They expect it to be in one place and be able to consume that on whatever surface and device that they want. And so that sort of like plethora of consumer choice 10 years from now is going to be even more dramatic than it is today because those young people have had that expectation since day one. So, building on that last thought, in the future, if you're competing with say Netflix for mind share, will you become more like Netflix or will Netflix become more like YouTube? I mean, it's a it's I I think that our approach is going to be thero approach that you've seen on YouTube. You should expect that same approach uh going into the future. Like I said, we produce the stage. We will be the leaders when it comes to technology. Whether it's our investment in AI and the algorithm in terms of how the product looks and feels, all the bells and whistles we build for creators, you should expect us to continue to do that. But it's going to be our creators that actually determine that sort of creative journey where it goes. And I like that because our creators are infinitely creative. There are um you know 100 million creators in India uploaded videos on YouTube. We have 15,000 creators in India over a million subs. When I was here last just a few months ago uh that number was I think 11,000. When I first started at YouTube like 10 years ago that number was like four or five. So just this proliferation of amazing content, amazing creativity is what you know is what YouTube is today and that's what you should expect it to be 5 10 years from now too for content like Hollywood and Bollywood. I've had this conversation with a friend of mine who was recently putting out a movie. I know he did consider putting it on YouTube straight up and charging a fee uh a smaller fee albeit but then comes in the concern of piracy if he were not to go the theater or the multiplex route. Do you have any thoughts about that? If I'm a filmmaker Mhm. and I don't go to a multiplex or a theater and I come to YouTube and I release a movie there, uh how do you prevent somebody from copying it and republishing it? Um we have uh for a long time invested very heavily in the DRM tools that that that try to prevent that from happening. Now, if somebody is um screen grabbing and screen gaping in a particular way, it's it's really hard. And there's two aspects obviously of piracy. Um by the way, I might be able to guess who this friend of yours is. I've heard this feedback directly from from him. So, um I watched the movie. Yeah. Yeah. It looks amazing. Yes. Yes. Um uh there's two aspects to piracy. one is the actual act of creating that copy and as I said things like DRM and what we do to sort of prevent against that at least create enough friction where it's not trivial to do and then the other aspect of course is the distribution piece because like piracy is ultimately for viewership and if you can kind of choke that piece off then that's sort of getting at one of the other use cases and that's where you know the fact that lots of content is ultimately distributed on YouTube we have that choke point around that type of uh um content in conjunction with our policy. So, it's a twofold approach. It's never perfect from that standpoint, but I think um history has shown that we have a pretty good handle in terms of that type of content never running rampant on YouTube. So, my audience, Neil, are largely young Indian wannabe entrepreneurs. Mhm. The line between a influencer and somebody who wants to start a business is fading in India like it is elsewhere in the world. A lot of my people believe that to sell anything you need to build influence first either on YouTube or other social media and then you build a product on top of that influence. Now to them if me at 38 let's say today I spend 30% of my time on YouTube 30% of my my free time on YouTube 30% of my free time on social media and the balance on broadcast news and the other platforms and Netflix and everything where should these people focus on building say somebody wants to start a t-shirt brand m where should he build influence today and give me some tips for him to build influence there today. Yeah. So, I think the first thing that I would say is I wouldn't I wouldn't describe if that's your sole goal, then I would I would think about YouTube a a bit differently. The way I think about YouTube is it's really the home for creators. And I use that term creator specifically as opposed to influencer or what have you because the primary purpose of your presence and investment on YouTube has to be uh the act of creation about having an idea whatever the topic having whether it's funny whether it's sports whether it's business and sharing it. So that's if that's not really fundamentally the goal then I think it becomes a bit harder on YouTube. Now having said that if that is a goal then what I hear over and over from YouTubers you know here in Mumbai but really all over the world is that YouTube is their home because it is a place where they um have that connection to their audience in a way that is deeper and more authentic than they can get anywhere else. And so they keep coming back to that. Um you know Jimmy Donaldson Mr. beast has these five pillars of focus in his studio in his office. The very first one is YouTube first because he knows that everything that he has derived uh has come from that investment on YouTube. And so if you do that but do it through a creator mindset then I think it affords you a world of opportunities because then you can use that home base to build audiences elsewhere or drive those audiences back. but more importantly to build all kinds of other businesses. There's of course how you monetize content on YouTube through advertising or a cut of the ESVOD revenues. But what's really interesting about YouTube is that if you want to write a book or if you have a clothing line or if you have um some other product that you're very excited about, YouTube can be the home base by which you build all of those businesses over and over. And I see that um happen with our top creators uh you know the Mr. Beasts of the world but really um you know millions of our creators um over over time. It's a kind of a long answer but that's really but I think that's important because it's not a place that's a fly by night place. If you were to replace the influencer in my question to content creator, say in me, Nikil wants to sell t-shirts. I need to create some kind of content before I can go about selling my t-shirts. So, I have somebody watching my content where I can market this t-shirt. What will work today? What I'm asking you is in a very euphemized manner, what is the YouTube algorithm to a lay man like me and what can I do today to succeed on it? Success in my definition in this particular subject would be the number of views and distribution I get. Yeah, I would say that what the most important advice that I give to two pieces of advice that I give to somebody thinking about building a career on YouTube. The first is um really think hard about what type of content you're passionate about. So if it happens to be t-shirts or something related to it. No, I want to sell t-shirts. I want you to tell me content. Yes. But I don't I think that if your only goal in life is to sell t-shirts, then you better also really care and have passion around creating content. It shouldn't be a means to an end, right? Um so that that's what I meant by home of creators. uh because um if you don't have passion around that, you're not going to be your authentic self and fans will figure that out very very quickly and you're not going to build a fan base. And so the first and most important thing that I would say is think hard about what you are really really excited about. Um, you know, we work with all kinds of, you know, athletes on our platform and, um, it comes through really, really quickly when they're talking about something that they're really excited about versus not, right? Like it's not just about throwing up a piece of content. And that's super, super important because like the power of YouTube is that it's not just an algorithm of your favorite meme of the week or favorite, you know, what have you. It is about your face, your you as the creator and you've built that because you talk about something authentically that your fans uh understand. That's really the most important thing and I say that over and over. That's the difference between somebody who's who stops doing it after a few months and that really continues. The second um you know YouTube can be a bit of a slow burn. Um, and so if you are passionate about something, care deeply about it, give it time because you want to um, set expectations with your audience about what you're going to talk about, what's your content going to be about, what are you going to do, and how you're going to go about doing it. And that builds over time. And that builds in terms of followerships but it actually also builds in terms of you know the algorithm because the algorithm is just a reflection of the audience. So those are the two most important things. A really smart person once said about passion that the passion about something goes away when you truly understand something. Do you think what is passion to you? Because the answer to my question, you said, you know, you should build around what you're passionate about. What is the definition of passion? Oh, um, well, I think it is, uh, something that you have, uh, such deep and abiding interest in that you would just keep doing it if it wasn't for all of these other goals as well. Is there anything like that, Neil? Would you do something if what is what is that for you? Um you know my background is I am a technologist by training. I've been interested and you know let's say passionate about technology since I was a really young kid. Um I went to high school in Lucknau. I had a little uh software startup back in the day building software for for for other high school kids and teachers. And so I've always had a deep and abiding interest in technology. But I have also from a very very early days, for lack of a better term, been a media junkie. Like I love stories in the general in broadest sense of the term. Movies, music, sports. I'm a sports nut. Um those are like two abiding passions I've had since I could like I was, you know, probably five or six years old. And but you're talking about consuming something. I'm talking about you consuming practicing something? Uh well I um I mean I do try to practice those things. I'm not very good at them. So that's uh uh in terms of my my my love of sports, but I'm highlighting it because um those are areas of of passion of mine and the way that I practice them is what I do every day. I think that YouTube is one of the few places that combines both those passions that I have um both technology as well as media. And so, you know, did I stumble upon this? Probably like I got lucky that I was given given this opportunity. But those really are a place where I get to work on technology in service of like the thing that I really love. The more I think about passion and talent, Neil, in my life, it's starting to sound to me more as an output than as an input. I believe I'm passionate or talented at something. When I do something and I'm a little bit better at it than my peer group. Uh I was having this conversation with someone. If I believed that I was passionate about playing cricket and I played cricket for 10 years, trained really hard and sucked at it, I don't think I would be passionate about cricket. So passion is almost an output. Talent is almost an output. less so an input to me today. Do you think you were good at technology and hence you felt like you could be passionate about it? It's interesting. I mean I think what you're describing is kind of like almost a flywheel or chicken and egg type of a thing. Um I have always been passionate about sports for example, right? I played little league, I played soccer, I played cricket. Um, I was never good enough to But were you good? Were you better than the people you played with? I was okay. But I But I but that interest still continues today. I love playing basketball with myself. Are you generally a modest person? Like I was asking your team earlier. They said you're a quiet person. Uh, I am I tend to be a quiet person. Yes, that's probably how my wife would describe me. You seem more like a euphemism versus embellishment kind of person. My wife calls me even kill me Neil. So that's uh that is I think a pretty apt description. So you're not very emotive. Uh I can I can be emotive. Uh I mean my kids would say that I can be emotive sometimes but uh I'm I'm pretty even killed in terms of my day-to-day in terms of how I go about myself. And I think part of it has to do with I think perspective. Um I think that uh whether there's challenges that you face in your work life or even in your personal life, they can be very very hard. But um you know keeping things in perspective is really often times the best way to to get through them. Is that good for work? Um I think that it is good for work. I mean, I think the things that are really important um in my job leading YouTube is actually having a level head to be because that allows for I think sort of the most well-considered judgment around things. I I always say that, you know, by the time a decision comes up to me, uh it's usually a decision between two bad choices because if it was easier, then it would have been made several levels below me in the organization. And so if that's the nature of the types of decisions I have to make, um I'd rather make them with a level head, a cool head. Um I'd also like to make them with, you know, principles that I've hopefully thought about well ahead of time. Um especially when it comes to difficult trade-offs. Um so yeah, I think it is a useful skill um in my professional life. You mentioned Lucknau just now. uh you were born in the west in the US, came back for high school and then went back and I read that your father was from IIT who went to the US to do his PhD. Mhm. Uh the one thing that stood out to me is you grew up on things like Transformers and Baseball and Star Wars. So even though you look like me, you're not really somebody who grew up on the same diet of content as me. Um, you know what I would say about that though, Nicole? Probably the biggest reason for that is uh because you're younger than me. No, seriously, like I do think that I'm 51, so that that does that does make a bit of a difference. Um, but you know, it's interesting like I so I like you said, I went to high school in in Lucknau. My dad I was born in in um uh in Indiana. My dad was getting his PhD. So when my parents were were grad students was when I was born and um came back here for for high school and yes you know that was a part of the diet that I grew up on. You know Transformers and you know Star Wars and and all of that. Um but I'd say a couple things even back then and now we're I'm really dating myself so like you're talking like mid 80s. Um a lot of those things had spilled over to my friends here. Um, but I would say uh not particularly uh a little bit a little bit but I but the other the other thing though is like you know back to what we were talking about like um the these were specific types of interests but I think that if you broadened it out you like I fell in love with cricket for example right away and why because I I liked all kinds of sports and so whether it was baseball or basketball growing up or cricket when I was in high school, like the nature of the competition, um the nature of sort of teamwork and how those things happened like that was like really natural for me and and also just lots of ways to have relationships and conversations with people. Um you know, I loved a particular set of movies. Um but then you know I uh remember watching what was popular here and actually you know back to back to media that was right around the time that the media landscape here started to change dramatically too which was there was of course Bollywood and then you know what T-Series represented in Bollywood but it was also the advent of things like Star. So that was like a precursor to a lot of what we're talking about today in terms of just changing the media diet through lots of choice for example, right? And so that was a big sort of I think foundational thing for me when I was a kid. And I I think you know again people always find these sorts of threads like in retrospect um to kind of sort of justify what they've done in the rest of their careers. But I do think that like that early especially in those formative years of just falling in love with all these different types of media and storytelling was an important part of my childhood that I sort of carried through because you know it was one of those things where growing up um in the US like I love baseball I love I love you know Transformers etc. And then coming here where you know I sounded funny like I didn't have sort of like those immediate things to connect with people on but finding some of these common ground types of things like sports like music etc was like really formative for me and I do think that that's probably back to your sort of passion or interests like that's carried forward um in the rest of my career because I do think that like the one of the foundational things is we as human beings um are storytellers. Like the way we connect with each other is like telling stories. Like I'll remember an anecdote about you in this conversation and you'll likely do that about me. Um well, I'll remember the the story. Yeah. The story you walked through in terms of your own media diet evolution. Like obviously I know your bio, your enormous success professionally, but like that was an interesting anecdote that you told me that was like true to who you are, right? And so you've been wealthy a long time. I remember reading this thing about Google offering you $100 million not to quit. Not today, but 15 years ago, which was a lot of money. What is it? I like that you're waiting for the question at this point and not reacting. I want to see where you're going to take this. What is it about, you know, there's a I can put you in a box, not in a bad way, but in the manner that techie growing up, uh, IIT dad, I'm going to make the assumption and extrapolate that you were fairly nerdy growing up, Indian origin, making a lot of money in the US in the last 20, 30 years. When you come from that background to India, A, what is working for Indian origin people in the US who are accomplishing as much as you are? And B, when you come here, does projecting patriotism to India almost help open up a market which you and your peer group believe will be really large going forward tomorrow? Um when you say projecting patriotism, you mean like Indian professing a love for uh like this the admiration for India? No, I feel like deep down we are all wearing a mask. Mhm. The mask changes depending on who we are sitting around. uh now that the world is so connected the masks have become more nuanced cuz one mask in a certain geography can be viewed by another in another geography and YouTube has played a big part in that. Mhm. So when you come to India now Neil Moan the CEO of YouTube what masks work and what don't and which one do you have on? Oh my goodness. Um well uh hopefully I'm not very sophisticated in masks. So um I always like to think that it's what you see is what you get. Um uh and by the way don't believe every single headline that you read even if it was 15 years old. So I'll I'll uh to start address the first part of your question. Um, I would say that uh I mean again just in my in my particular role um what's amazing about YouTube is it really is truly global like you just said like this this conversation uh you know you've had enormous success here in India but you've had success all over the world and so I expect everything that we talk about here is going to be consumed not just here But really in every other part of the world and hopefully what we're talking about is just as applicable in that sense. uh you know when I when I come to India I mean I I I really um I'll say a few things that I've said before that I think um really ring true is you see the enormous success of India on YouTube but in general in the creative and you know we started this conversation talking about waves uh in the creative industries through numbers and data right like four out of five Indians is on YouTube um you know billions of hours of you know content being created consumed 100 million channels uploading videos 15,000 over a million million subs um you know Indian creators uh uh generated 21,000 crores uh uh $2.5 billion on YouTube in the last 3 years I could go on and on and on but it is not until you are here on the ground that you viscerally understand that and what I mean by that is the vibrancy around um the creator economy and it's like kind of and you sort of alluded to this earlier. It's like it's two things. Yes, you have to be a creative person, an authentic thought. You have to share it with yourself, but you also have to be an entrepreneur. You have to be someone who's really and what I mean by that is like truly entrepreneurial in the best sense like someone who's willing to work hard and really give into their passion kind of a thing. And I see that every time I'm here in India and um I really think that that's where all of this success has come from. Um and it's not just like their success of these creators in India. Something like the on the order of 15% or uh like uh which translates to about 45 billion hours of watch time of content created by Indian creators is actually consumed outside of India. So, it's an exporter of ideas and culture. And so, but you viscerally see that when it's happening here, when you see that just walking the streets in terms of how people what they're watching on their phones, uh, you see that in the conversations I have with creators. And so, that's really what I would reiterate every time I'm here. Whether you call that a mask or not, that's that's the reality from my standpoint. I'm an investor first and foremost. Mhm. If I had $100 to invest and I could buy Spotify, YouTube, a movie theater business, a Hollywood studio, a news broadcasting company, where would I put my money? If I could only put it in one place for the next decade. I mean, I can't I'm not going to give you investment advice. You're a much savvier investor than I am. I can't give you any advice. Um, I would again just just uh maybe broaden it. I would just say I think that really YouTube is different than all of those pieces that you touched on. I mean, we interact with, we probably compete with some of those players that you mentioned, but um, you know, our lane is different. It really is about watching, sharing, and creating video. Full stop. That's what we uh want to do. We want to make sure that we continue to do it. We are the world's oldest and largest creator economy and uh you know it's my ambition as CEO to make sure that continues to be the case. And if I were to go back to the fact that I'm speaking to entrepreneurs who want to use this platform to grow a business, can you give me five non-obvious insights about the world of content that I might not be able to find online? Yeah. Uh let me say a few things. First is um and I don't know if this is obvious or not but I'll just I'll say sort of the things that I I I I think an upand cominging entrepreneur would would want to think about. One is you know places like YouTube but other platforms also um have really eliminated the need or the like the fact of a barrier between you and your audience or your customer or however you think about it. Like you are in the driver's seat. you get to control what that conversation looks like and you get the feedback immediately. That's the second thing. It's like as opposed to feedback that would happen in the traditional way whether you were an entrepreneur and getting the feedback from the market 6 months down the road or from your investors a year down the road. Feedback on a place like YouTube is instantaneously. You see, you literally see it in the comments within minutes of you, seconds, minutes within you posting the video. So that's a world uh that you really really have to be ready for. The third we talked about um which is true uh truly global right like so um you can have local regional national sort of ambitions but you know content tends to be global storylines do translate. They are specifics obviously and obviously culture matters a lot. Um, but that's that's kind of the the the the third thing that I would say. One thing that I think is was not obvious for a while is now starting to be more obvious around content is um it truly is multi-creen, right? Like you know like the mental model when you say the word YouTube, what pops into your head? You might be a mobile phone. Well um in the US the majority of content is actually consumed on television screens and you know that could happen in the rest of the world. It's our fastest growing screen. So just you know kind of this multimodality multi-urface is is is super super important. And then I think the very last thing I'll say again from an entrepreneur standpoint is um our fundamental business model is an advertising model and that's because we're large scale right like it is a way to reach a very large pool of people with your content if it's ad supported. But I also think that uh entrepreneurs should think about other types of monetization models like ESVOD. We have a subscription business right with YouTube premium. Um direct fanf funding models right especially if you have niche content. If you are you know creating content in a particular education vertical that is super super valuable um but probably doesn't have broad reach then a direct consumer fanf funding type model might make sense. We talked about shopping and and merch and those types of use cases. So be um creative and flexible about the monetization models. Uh but be very rock solid in terms of the content that you're that's true to you. If all of all the world is stories and stage a stage uh if Neil had to quit YouTube tomorrow and build YouTube's competition because the world should not just have one, two, or three stages but many stages. What would you build that can compete with YouTube as a better place to tell stories? Uh well hopefully if that's going to be the case, we're doing it within YouTube. Um, I always say to our teams that we really do have to continue to disrupt ourselves. That's what our creators and our viewers expect whether they say it or not. They they do expect that. Um, you know, one area that we haven't talked a lot about, but I am very excited by and I I do think it will be disruptive not just to YouTube, but to the creative industries in general is is AI and everything that's happening with AI. And um I think it can be disruptive up and down the stack. What we're doing, and you know, I'm sure lots of competition is doing, but what we're doing at YouTube is how do we turn it into tools that allow for that disruption to occur because you can't bury that technological disruption, but um allow for it to feel like it is in the hands of the creative people. And uh so I'll just give you a couple of examples. Um, the technology exists today when you hit that plus but plus camera on YouTube to now within a few seconds give it a text prompt of, you know, let's change this set to one where we're sitting in a spring meadow and there's birds and flowers outside. And that's probably something uh that would have taken us days or weeks to put together if that's what we wanted our set to be. AI allows you to do that. now in seconds. And that's a collaboration between YouTube and Google DeepMind. So that's pretty profound from a user standpoint. As fans, we're like, \"Wow, we get get the benefit of this.\" Um, really, really quickly. I also think it is a tool in the hands of the creator. Like it was your decision or my decision to come up with that creative idea and now it's there. And so that's really cool because now this technology is in the hands of a lot more creators. But it is disruptive because it did disrupt a lot of things that needed to happen in the preAI scenario, right? Like that that days or weeks that would have taken. So I don't want to be naive to that. And so I just um I think that's where you're going to see lots of really interesting disruption in a way that creates new opportunities because now 10,000 more people could produce that content than otherwise could have. But I do recognize that it's actually also going to disrupt certain parts of that sort of value chain or stack or whatever you want to call it um through the process. And I could give you many examples of that in the creative industry. If I were to put back the investor hat for a second, let's assume OpenAI used YouTube data for Sora. And again, if you had $100 that you could bet behind one large AI company, which company has the most data? Is it Google? Is it Microsoft? Is it as an outsider trying to take a bet on the world of AI broadly? Where do you think that money should go? Remove the remove like your own company from the pitch. Um, you know, is it I think it's hard to answer who has the most data or what have you. I think that um data is sort of one part of of the equation. I do think that um technological breakthroughs and investment in innovation is another big part of it. I I get to uh work very closely with Google deep mind every day particularly in areas of you know audio and video right with the VO models etc. So I see how powerful that innovation can be. And then there's a third piece which doesn't actually get talked about that much but I think is also very important which is the applications of these models. How do they actually show up? How do they show up in a way where they're useful and they capture the imagination but not just capture the imagination once and then they're forgotten about but then really become something mainstream. And so I think all three of those pieces are important. At YouTube, our focus is really obviously working on the deep sort of technology and collaboration with Deep Mind, but also just as much turning it into tools and features. So, I described this product to you called Dreamcreen, which is like, you know, kind of this super interesting product. Wow. Oh my god, you can you can create that amazing video out of thin air from just this quick text prompt. Of course, it's amazing. It's mindblowing. Um, but when we talk to our creators, when I talk to creators, they they love that feature. They think it's powerful. It democratizes creation. All all great great stuff. Uh, but they also talk to me things about like, you know, why don't you do something even more kind of basic basic and mundane, which is like, why not just give me a translation of my video in 10 big languages? Why not give it to me in a thousand different languages? And why not do it in a way where it captures um my tone my inflection and AI will be able to do that and that will be magical too and that will have a profound impact on like you know some some kid um you know trying to learn algebra in a small Indian village uh and that's like a profound impact on humanity but it's not as interesting at least it's not kind of like like as glitzy of a use case. Another one that comes to mind that creators always talk to me about is, you know, one of their biggest challenges is sort of the blank blank um uh screen problem. Like, I have a video, I have no idea what to do next, and I'm a travel vlogger. Um well, could I iterate with an AI to actually help me come up with ideas on, you know, the next where should I take my next trip and what sort of video should I produce around it? Uh so those are these are the types of things where a lot of AI innovation is happening because that's what makes it actually practical for for real users. Are attention spans falling or growing? I can watch a Netflix or a YouTube show for 10 hours and binge it and yet I hear people's attention spans have come down to 10 seconds or 20 seconds. What do you think? Uh I don't see it one way or the other. I mean our our we see all all nature of consumption patterns on YouTube. Um what are you betting more on? Long form or shorts? I mean I think I really view them as kind of a I I don't view them as two separate things I guess is what I would say. I I think short sort of stands on its own in the sense in that it's like it's vertical. It's shot on a mobile phone. Maybe it gets consumed more in a feed, but all it is is just like it's shorter video. It's like if you take uh put your head back to where YouTube wasif we were just celebrating our 20th birthday, right? So go back to the very early days of YouTube that people call that shorts. That was shorts back then. And so it's just like I think it's like a frame of reference thing. Um and in our corpus we see our long form content in many cases growing even longer um getting more episodic in nature as you're describing. uh and we have, you know, short form content that's 15 seconds, but we get we get uh lots of asks for that short for short form content to be over 3 minutes long. So, like it's just like a a a continuum. And I think in terms of attention span, you know, I you know, you can have a long session just consuming quote unquote short content and vice versa. So I I see it really um I kind of see it in in we see it in all all different directions. I don't think there's a one one or the other. I use YouTube a lot as a second screen while I'm at work. So if I use it for I'm watching like podcasts and I don't know random like studies and stuff like that. I actually find that this is me being really honest. When I turn on a screen, my TV, and I watch Netflix, Mhm. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. But when I turn on my TV and I watch YouTube, very subconsciously, I feel like I'm doing something right. I don't know how to describe this. Yeah. Because somewhere in my subconscious, the latter makes me think I'm learning. And when I'm learning, some anxiety in me is alleviated. I don't know if that's by design or not. Uh I'm not sure if I it's not by design in the sense of anything that we have done to either communicate that or pick the content. So I feel like the credit really goes again to our amazing creators, you know, the 100 million creators that upload in India or wherever. I will say um learning is a really big use case on YouTube. And when I say learning, I mean the broad definition of the term learning. Um, you know, frankly, in my own experience, I used YouTube a lot for that. Like, and all kinds of niches of learning are really really popular. Obviously, there's the obvious learning like, you know, high school kid in the classroom kind of learning. And then there's the other sort of very obvious thing, which is like, well, how do I fix my bike or how did I how do I fix my garage door? But like the really deep learning use cases are pretty esoteric and can and and have lots and lots of content in very particular places. A colleague of mine always talks about his love of, you know, um, woodworking, right, and carving. And you can go really deep on that on YouTube. I love like, it's kind of random, but I love like logistics and logistics patterns and how things happen sort of in infrastructure. You can go really deep on that on YouTube. So that is not something that we sort of pick those content verticals on purpose. But just like every niche sort of exists on YouTube, there's 20 billion videos that have been uh uploaded to YouTube. That that's that's every that's where the experience comes from. So 5 years ago when I turned on YouTube, it was to play songs. Mhm. That position in my mind somehow is lost has been lost to Spotify. Mhm. Now when I think of a song, I go to Spotify. When I think of a podcast or something around learning, I go to YouTube. When I think of entertainment, entertainment, I go to Netflix. Do you think the music battle Spotify has gained a lot of traction in over the last few years? Why do you feel that way about music? I don't know. It's just how I use it. Mhm. I didn't have Spotify six, seven years ago. And also, I'm not the generic Indian user. Mhm. But somehow my music needs today are not met by YouTube. But more needs of mine around learning are met by YouTube. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, like I said, I mean, learning is a very large use case on YouTube across every demographic, every part of the world. It's one that I'm very proud of. You know, I saw a stat 90% plus of classroom teachers use YouTube in the classroom in some particular way. So that is core to what we do. But music is our I'd say almost oldest and one of our most important verticals by far. It's really core to the YouTube uh heritage starting from you know the early days of YouTube and T-Series and T-Series is still one of our most important most strategic largest partners. There's a few things that I would say that's happened I think to music in in India in general regardless of you know YouTube or Spotify which is you know the growth of um you know Indian origin music pop music um in that sort of not classic Bollywood right like you know we have amazing YouTubers like King who grew up on our platform uh who are superstars in of their own right but sort of charted their own path and we you know he's he's obviously kind of a mega star but there's lots lots and lots of examples like that. And um I would say that that's a really big phenomenon on YouTube just like it is on other platforms. One of the things that um I want to continue to do is um uh invest more in terms of actually showcasing that on YouTube. So again, not about the algorithm or what have you, but having charts for example, popular charts in not just in sort of classic Bollywood Hindi, but in all of these different languages to recognize those artists. So we're doing more and more work like that getting more precise about uh algorithmic recommendations around spec because the Indian music landscape is so diverse in terms of language and style that um it sort of in that sense presents like a unique challenge and opportunity to how sophisticated the algorithm needs to be to be able to make good recommendations in that context. And so those are areas that we're um investing in. We're actually going to talk more about some of that at Waves too. like the first night of waves is the the the YouTube cultural night which is you know our our chance to put our best foot forward of all of our YouTubers. So yeah, music is is very important. I'm not sure why you feel that way but Indian music is like a core part of our our our investment. Any fleeting thoughts? Neil, you want to tell us something? Anything that you'd like to tell us? Um no I think what I would say first of all thank you so much for making the time for doing this. It's really a privilege uh to have the conversation. Um I would just say that um every time I come back to India, I'm I'm amazed at sort of how much the Indian creative economy and creative industry continues to grow. We at YouTube are privileged to play our role in that. And as I said earlier in the conversation, I think we're just getting started. It's still the early innings, right? Thank you so much for doing this, Neil. You make India proud and hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me. Okay. All right. How was it? It was good. You're You're a pro. You're very very well prepared. You guys have a studio there, too. Or uh Awesome. Very cool. All right, Nico. Take care. Thank you, everybody. Will you be are you speaking there or are you No, I'm participating in some round table with the PM. Oh, nice. Yeah. Okay. I think I I'll probably see you there. You'll probably be on it. [Music]"

    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] If I were to ask you to extrapolate in the world of tomorrow 10 years from now from a very capitalistic lens is a huge population a boon or a win. [Music] Can you sleep, Bill, if you drink coffee so late at night? It might delay my going to sleep a little bit, but it'll keep me energized. So, uh, I have a long flight, so I get the sleep is always complicated. You're always in a hurry when you're in India. It's so much nicer to spend time with you when you're not in India. Why is that? Um, well, I'll organize some of my trips where I take time off here. uh you know, next year we're talking about that I'll go up to a psalm and they tell me that's pretty nice. So hopefully I'll schedule a couple days uh for just pure relaxation. But when I'm working, you know, it's it's great to see there's so many new innovators here. Uh we did manage to pack the schedule. You know, there's a lot of ministries that we have partnerships with. I think I saw more ministers this time than ever before, but it was they were all great meetings, right? It's been a fun trip. We did a thing with Sachin. I guess it's your production company or something that helped put together a very creative uh So, you played cricket first time? Well, we we were on a tennis court and so we were hitting balls with the cricket bracket and the tennis. We were kind of making fun of the the the two different sports. Uh so that that that was relaxing. Yeah. So, we met recently in Switzerland and I asked you many things off camera. Uh, so I spent the last week reading source code. Oh, thanks. Yeah, it took me a long time. I read much slower than you. I presume it took me 14 15 hours. So, my time in the car, on my flight, in all my travel and before going to bed has been source code. So I know more about you now than I have ever. Fantastic. So a lot of what is in the book, Bill, it's a great book. I I would recommend everybody read it. But a lot of what is in the book is also something I might expect of Bill Gates. Like my childhood was very different in the sense that when you used to sneak out of home when your parents went to bed, you went to a computer laptop, right? Yes. That was I I was very lucky. I got to use computers a lot even in high school. So what isn't in the book, Bill? you know, the book I I feel like I, you know, was pretty frank about uh you know, the challenges my parents felt raising me and uh you know, how uh my originally I was not a very good student. You know, at least I wasn't getting good grades and then I eventually it bugged me that people thought maybe I wasn't that smart. So, I just said, \"Okay, I guess I should get good grades.\" uh you know I got in trouble at Harvard uh when I was doing first using the computer and but you got you got into trouble almost for using the computer without the requisite permission from the administrator but that's not really trouble you know what I mean I was at the time it felt like it might be uh you know cuz they uh they were acting pretty tough um but you I'm not somebody who had a traumatic childhood that explains my you know whatever energ energy or ambition I have. I had a great childhood. You know I had some conflict with my mother where she would try to get me to you know fit what she wanted. And you know in a sense she succeeded in in making me want to exceed even her expectations. So there's some energy that I got, you know, from trying to uh, you know, get my freedom or impress her. Um, but I'd say the simple story is that it, you know, it's almost ideal. I wish everybody had the stability. Uh, you know, my dad was really, uh, terms of his values. You know, he'd grown up in a very poor household. his father had only gone to sixth grade. Um, and and yet he was very sophisticated, always calm about everything. It's nice having parents who are calm. So I I rightly or wrongly have made this presumption of late that very successful, very many successful entrepreneurs do not necessarily come from well-rounded families. Uh when I read the book I could I could see that your mom your mother was projecting Kennedy's almost the idealistic family. She was in charity. Your dad was in law. Uh also very interestingly you speak about your mom a lot as when you're younger. Your dad shows up much later in life at least in the writing and your sisters even after that. Is that how you felt their importance at different points in your life? It was your mom when you were a kid, your dad when you were significantly older. Well, my dad worked very long hours, so he would leave even before we had breakfast most mornings. He'd head off to work. Uh when he came home, that was when we had dinner. Uh my parents were out uh socializing in ways that were helpful to my dad's career three or four nights a week. And so my dad um until later was a wasn't interacting with me that much. I mean, he would I'm sure he would talk to my mom about what was going on, but you know, uh, the fact that he set a good example influenced me and, um, you know, the values that he had. But no, my my mom was the the key relationship. My sisters, I could have talked more about them. Uh, you know, I have one sister who's a bit older and the other one's nine years behind me. So when I'm a senior, you know, which is the last time I'm at the house, uh, you know, she's a third grader. So we had a fun relationship, but not, uh, you know, more than just playful, uh, until we're both adults. So would I be wrong in my presumption that success in the capitalistic world of today is somehow bred by one form of adversity or another in childhood? Well, I think if you look at the Steve Jobs story, you know, he's adopted uh you know, his parents uh kept his sister and they didn't keep him. And so he ends up with a pretty negative view towards his his father his uh biological uh father. You know, Elon Musk had a a fairly uh complicated father, you know, who would was apparently very tough on him. So often when you see people who are, you know, high achievers, there's some, you know, something they're trying to prove. In my case, you really don't have that. I mean, the only negative thing that happens to me in my childhood is one of my friends, uh, Kent Evans, uh, died when I was 16 and he was 17. But, you know, I was already, uh, you know, my energy and ambition, you know, had already been set. So, I don't, you know, wouldn't say that was connected. So it is I think some people are surprised you know where did I get this desire in my 20s to be you know compared to everybody else who was starting software companies I mean by my standards they were quite lazy um also having known you a little bit and having read the book now this one quality that you have where you're able to put your head down focus and cram many hours of work at one go or be not cognizant to the things happening in the world around you but focused on one thing. Where does that come from? I know in the last part of your book you spoke about how today you might be diagnosed as autistic and is it that or is it is it some kind of drive which is coming from somewhere else? I think there's a a strong genetic component to that ability to focus. uh you know particularly as people get older their willingness to be very confused and just live with their confusion you know and and until they really figure it out uh they almost you know give yourself a hard time and you know think about why can't I understand this uh you know I think that's that's something I was lucky uh from nature, you know, um my my parents didn't push me to be that way. And it was there, you know, pretty early on, you know, even the thing where it was fascinating to me that my grandmother was so much better at cards than I was. And I had to think a long time to figure out, okay, she is running a a a state machine. She is remembering every card that goes by. And if you remember every card that goes by, okay, there is uh an impact on all these different card games because we played a lot of different games. Um and she would never, you know, kind of give it away. She sort of forced me to to think it through on my own. So, that's an early sign that yeah, I I can go off and kind of ignore uh uh what's going on. And, you know, I'm very lucky uh even at, you know, this age, if somebody hands me a a new book about something, I'll, you know, shut the door and four hours later, hopefully I've I've I've been able to get through it. Somebody really smart was telling me that to be a hero you either need to be or inspiring or relatable. Do you think Silicon Valley or the tech moguls in the US are using vulnerability to transition from or inspiring? But in a condens, this might sound a little condescending, not that I mean it, robot-like behavior to more humanlike personas. Like if you look at Mark Zuckerberg with him, you know, wearing his new clothes, his chain, his watch. Uh is the world going that way where you don't want that cleancut or inspiring hero anymore? You need something more relatable and people are showcasing their vulnerabilities to meet that end. Well, I don't think, you know, I think Mark sincerely likes extreme sports. Uh, and, you know, he really does, you know, engage in that. I never found that uh all that attractive. So, I think he's being genuine. Um, you know, he's a great family person. um you know he's he's he's still pretty young. He just turned 40, which nowadays I have to consider that uh a young person. You know, I'm I I think the the people who get to know you are the people either your family or the people who work with you very closely. And you know, take for example, Steve Jobs. He was tough on himself. uh he did have the most unbelievable sense of people just in an intuitive way and of of good design, you know, so his skills and mine don't even overlap that much. He was not an engineer and I'm not a design person. I wish I was a design person and I don't know if he wished he was an engineer. He was good at picking engineers and so Apple uh you know really distinguished itself but it wasn't it wasn't an act um he he was a natural uh I had to learn how to give speeches and uh all that and you know even at my best I'm not uh as much of a speech giver as he was. Um so he's pretty singular I would say. Um, you know, maybe Elon in his in a different way is is kind of singular. I think of Mark as a pretty normal person actually. Uh, you know, he's got a great wife, you know, very serious about his kids. You just said that Steve Jobs was maybe too hard on himself. Are you hard on yourself, Bill? Why are you running around so much meeting all the politicians and everything? No, I think if you want to, you know, work hard and not fool yourself, you better be pretty hard on yourself. Uh, and Steve was, uh, tough on himself. And it makes you at first maybe not a very good manager because you tend to manage people like you manage yourself where you're just so tough on them. And you know for me that meant that in my early days I could get a lot out of people who were like me and you know so I probably missed some people who were very different than me that could have been you know part of the company. We were fairly homogeneous, very engineering oriented group. And it took a while before I realized, okay, somebody who's a good salesperson or a good manager, you know, may not be good at the way I think of IQ. IQ is much more varied. Talent is more varied than I realized. You know, I sort of thought, well, if you can do math, you can do anything. And if you can't do math, then you can't do anything. That's how simple uh that initial thing was. So I was you know it took me a lot of time uh to develop as a manager. You know I think as I moved to the foundation it was very important that I blend in people who like to work in the field in Africa with great scientists with great people who work with government. So I you know I was able to take the mistakes I'd made and learnings from Microsoft and um bring that to the foundation but you know the why I I chose uh to work so hard in my 20s I mean I I love the work I think 20s I get Bill the question is today oh today yeah well it's optional um it is a lot of fun. I get to work with smart people. I'm learning all the time. I, you know, I get to travel the world. The world is Haven't you traveled the world already? You know, in my Microsoft work, I went to Africa. I went to South Africa once and Egypt once. And so basically, you know, they don't buy much software in Africa. They buy some, but it's not now, you know, Africa's, you know, huge. uh in in what I do. So I' I've been exposed to different parts. So uh I certainly got to meet a lot of people that I'd never met at Microsoft. Yeah. If I were to ask you to extrapolate with no filters since you know more about AI than I will ever u in the world of tomorrow 10 years from now from a very capitalistic lens is a huge population a boon or a bin the let's say 20 years from now AI will have changed things enough that you know the just this pure capitalistic framework probably won't explain much because as AI's both as sort of white collar type work and as bluecollar work as the robots will get good hands and are able to do the physical things that that humans do say working in a factory or construction or you know going cleaning a a hotel room uh which you know the hands have to be awfully good uh to do those things. we'll we'll achieve that and we'll have a lot of the making the goods and services which is always we've always had a shortage a shortage of doctors of teachers of people to work in the factories those shortages won't exist and so it's it's a pretty profound change that will free up a lot of time you know you can retire early you can work shorter work weeks And it's going to require almost a philosophical rethink about okay how should time be spent because we don't need it to make enough food and make enough widgets and uh you know do enough medical diagnosis we will have created you know free intelligence you know in my day it was about computing was expensive it became free now it's intelligence like a doctor's intelligence is scarce you know India has more doctors than Africa, but still not nearly as many as it should. But AI uh will come in and provide, you know, medical uh IQ and there won't be a shortage. Uh that's and it's hard for those of us, you know, in my case spending almost 70 years in a year in a world of shortage to even adjust my mind because you know what are markets about? Markets are about scarce resources and a price is okay. You know, you get the employee because you're willing to pay pay them more. And um so, you know, I find myself trying to understand that future world, but uh it hasn't come into focus for me. And I I I enjoy engaging experts about okay, what does the economy look like? and and how will we choose to use the the freedom that will come and you know even if I'm wrong say it's 30 years that's not a very long time I mean my uh kids and certainly my grandkids uh a lot of their life will be in that that very changed world this economist John Maynard kins u I think the American model is largely kenasian where they print money the antithesis to hayek almost he said this many decades ago that the real question is what will the world do if one did not have to work if you had to like extrapolate one statement in 30 40 50 how many ever years what do we do if we don't have to work I don't have to work uh and so uh I I choose to work um because uh yeah because it's fun you know I take more vacation than I did when I was young but uh it's still, you know, basically full full-time work. And but it's if you had that your whole life, it's different than being able to retire early. I mean, at least we, you know, have a period of working and then, you know, if you said everybody could retire at at 40, you know, how radical is that? Um maybe not not that radical. Um but if you said you never need to work at least to me I have what you know that that is so different I think another very interesting question is if we all don't work do we get the same humans inherently are competitive with their peer groups I think so if I don't work say we are born tomorrow me you him we all don't work but we are bestow bestowed upon with the same resources and same social position. Will that work for us? Will No, I I your your point's a good one. We want to differentiate uh you know whether it's for our own ego or to be attractive or uh it's so we we are so adapted to this world of shortage. uh that you know maybe you know we'll create competitions in you know creativity or you know maybe we'll take some part of human activity I mean an extreme cases we're not going to have robots play cricket you know that's boring we'll let we'll reserve that just for the humans even if the robots could be you know way way better that's that's not interesting and So what activities might a country say no we're reserving this you know nurses are going to be humans or uh you know psychiatrists uh you know are we're going to you know decide that the that and so we might artificially uh ignore the fact that the the machines can uh can substitute for some of that. It's it'll really, you know, get down to the core of of human instinct. Yeah, we will figure out a hierarchy. May may not be the current one, but another way to segregate ourselves. Yes. The idea of, you know, pure communism that everybody, you know, is is totally the same. That's a pretty unnatural behavior for for humans. needs a lot of trust of a model like that to work and I think as the group gets larger trust is often not there inherently you've been the richest man in the world for a very long time Bill you've probably had access to everybody for a long long time I'm talking world leaders philosophers people at the cutting edge of everything what do you know that I I don't like one thing what have you learned by having lived in your shoes. I know a lot about science. You know, I've seen a lot of successful people um and you know, learn the habits um that they have. I do think you develop um instincts about, you know, who to hire, who to partner with just from mistakes and uh you know, pattern matching, you know, and I' I've been super lucky people like Warren Buffett who comes from a very different expertise than mine, you know, he and I have bonded over, you know, sharing ideas and kind of common view of how things work in the world and he he is on a lot of things just his wisdom has has been a huge help to me not so much about business but more about life well it's certainly you know the decisions you make about your personal life probably affect your happiness uh you know I know super successful people who aren't that happy uh and you know didn't apply their uh weren't able to map their incredible intelligence on to uh having a great uh relationship with their kids or uh you know their extended family. So it is human capability is is very strange that you can't uh you know like my friend Paul Allen um you know he was wonderful he was key to the success of Microsoft but he actually didn't end up enjoying himself um you know he felt like maybe people were going to take advantage of him and that that's you know this is a guy who had everything and yet it didn't didn't really create uh comfort or uh the happiness he he deserved. When people ask me what drives me, uh I mean I'm a I'm much less wise, experienced all of those things, but in my own little bubble, some people do ask me what drives me. I used to stupidly say whenever someone asked me how you got lucky or how you did well in life, my go-to answer used to be luck, which was never the truth because I think we all have all humans I think have a inflated sense of self subconsciously deep deep down like if I were to put 100 people in a room and ask how many of you are smarter than the majority I I would presume 99%. % or 89% of the room say yes. Maybe that's a slight exaggeration but I think the point holds but when I were to think about what drives me deeply in the beginning I think it was just money. I feel like I didn't have money. I wanted money because my conditioning my years growing up looking at the people around me with money they looked happy. I think money transitioned into relatively more power, jealousy, insecurity, seeking validation, different drivers for different parts of my life. And today I'm flirting with this notion like I'm part of your pledge and I I spend time with you every year on the offsite. And I don't know if you remember but last year I was asking these same questions because I genuinely do not know the answer. At times I might feel altruistic. At times I might feel like there is no point to more but at other times I will go back to the very relative nature of things and competition kicks in and I want more. Uh what I've wanted from our conversation today, it's more a question for me than it is for other people is this concept of motivational pluralism in a way where I can be motivated by different things at different points of time. I might also want to make money, but I might also want to give away money. I think you're at the forefront of that. Would you like to like share your thoughts on that? How does it make sense to want to make money while you want to also give away money? Well, even giving away money can be very egotistical. There's certainly ego involved. There is a high. I mean, you know, Ted Turner uh used to say that uh the Forbes list was which ranks people on their wealth was a bad thing because people would hesitate to give away money because they wouldn't uh achieve some rank on the on the Forbes list. And I think he had had a valid point there. You can never do anything that's totally pure. Mhm. Um because if it's really deeply moral then a little bit you think oh people will will praise that and so you know is it ego or not? Um you know in the end the the work you know like the work we've done with vaccines. Yeah. Um, you know, whether that was my ego or not, it, you know, it's a it's a real thing that happened. Um, you know, I I remember when I left Microsoft thinking, gosh, if it gets messed up, it's going to screw up my mind. Should I go back or not go back? And I'm so lucky that, you know, Steve did a very good job and now Satcha is doing uh a very good job. So, I haven't had to worry about that. It also helped that that made my Microsoft stock uh valuable enough that even though I given away uh a a lot, you know, I still uh you know, I'm not nearly as as rich as as some, but I'm in the top 20. Um and that's great. You know, I'm over the next 20 years I'll I'll be able to give a lot away. But even that's not doesn't get you out of the why the why do I I do it. Um I find like I don't feel altruistic. I feel like even when you quietly do something good in terms of giving away money which does something for someone, it is almost more intoxicating than a capitalistic pursuit which is making money. So they're both highs. Now, if I don't know which high is more appealing to me at which point of time, how do you switch between the two? You know, philanthropy isn't quite as competitive. I mean, you know, creating a company, you know, that uh it's pretty stark because, you know, there might be some category that if you get scale, you know, the other people just fall by the wayside. You know, it's not like you end up splitting. It's it's you know when we did Microsoft Office there were quite a few companies that were in that space that literally we they went away. Uh and you know we we competed with Google over the mobile phone operating system and we fell behind and you know today nobody remembers there was a a Windows mobile thing. It's just Android for non-Apple phones. It's basically all Android. That was a winner take all thing. And so when you get into one of those, you actually activate not only ego, but a little bit of fear. Uh and you know, certainly in my 20s and 30s, I that was part of it, which is wow, you know, I think I'm pretty good at this, but you know, have I just made that up? Uh am I really good? Will I be re revealed that I, you know, didn't do a good job? Uh, I've gotten past that now. I don't think I'm motivated by uh a a fear, but it's it was fascinating to me that, you know, I would when we would go on company retreats for Microsoft, it would bother me that the other leaders didn't think our survival was at risk. I was always coming up with no we have to worry about this, we have to worry about this because it was my whole life and I have to say leaving um and moving to the foundation made my life a little bit more sane because I wasn't always conjuring up the okay it could you know all uh you know completely blow up and so you know I engaged every emotion to drive myself in my 20s. So, I was having lunch with my team today, Bill. They're all like a bunch of them are 21, 23, 24. And even at 38, I'm so disconnected with how they think their their version of reality in a way. Whenever we've whenever I've seen you for a meal, lunch, dinner, beat, whatever, there's always wine. They say that people are like the vintage of wine from the year that they're born in. So let's say you were born in year X and you're from that vintage. What assumption of the world today or the youth of the world today do you think that you have which is not fully true? And how do you look at the world today but it doesn't resonate for the youth of today? Yeah. Well, it's nice to have your kids give you a hard time because you get a little bit of uh realizing, wow, uh there's a different way of looking at things. You know, some things like I'm very email ccentric, which my my youngest daughter thinks is so laughable. Uh and you know, when she sends me a text, I don't respond in five minutes, and she's like, \"What's wrong with you, uh, Dad?\" And I I'm not going to change it. I'm sorry. I'm I'm kind of stuck in my uh email centric ways. Uh you know, so I'll I'll just have to live with that. Um you know, I I you know, I was very lucky the insight that computing would become free. You know, for my generation, there were very few people who saw that. Uh, and so I, you know, I had an advantage because that implied a lot of things that that Microsoft could get out in in front of. Now, this this current revolution in a way, everybody kind of sees it coming. Uh, it's almost too wild to be true, but yes, it's it's not like there's only a small community who sees AI coming. And I'm I'm not sure, do the young people have an anticipation of what it's going to be like better. Um, I hope so because they're the ones who, you know, be in charge and and and have to deal with it. I think it's a rate of change that's greater than most most periods of history. you know, when we made in the US, you know, when we went from 50% farmers to 2% farmers, it you could still farm your whole generation. And it was your children that stopped being farmers, you know, because it happened over 60-year period. We go from a very high percentage down here, you know, even within a generation, uh, you know, certain skills are aren't going to be as as needed. So, I think that's a pretty wild thing uh to be to be changing things, you know, and and you're it's nice to surround your pe yourself with with young people uh you know, and have their insights. Of course, your customers aren't all young, so you have to, you know, stay in touch with what they're thinking as well. If I may pay you a compliment bill, after having spent time with you for a few years, I feel like you care lesser today about what people think about you and that is making you increasingly more appealing to the youth and I think that comes out in your book as well. No, I mean if anybody can afford to not, you know, think about, you know, there are people who like me more than there should, there are people who hate me more than they should. I mean, it's, you know, a wild mix, you know, including crazy conspiracies. Uh, and so I do think with age, your ego needs go down a bit. Um, your desire to help others succeed versus just yourself. uh you know you get a little bit they call it gener more generative and uh sharing advice. Um having kids helps with that a lot and [Music] um you know so I should have the luxury of not uh worrying about these things you know ironically I think that is the definition of cool for the youth today not caring Thank you, Bill. Thank you for doing this. And I think I'm seeing you next year. No, great to see you. And uh yeah, so you're coming to the giving pledge. Oh, perfect. Uh no, it's always fun to see you there. And yeah, uh thanks. This was a blast. Thank you. Actually want to ask you some advice. So I'm feeling like I'm losing out on the whole AI world. So I want to go take a job somewhere in the US or an internship unpaid. Where would you suggest it? How do I go about being in the forefront of that world just in terms of learning the implications not so much the development of you know with all your business experience maybe the open AI guys would have some role where you would be super valuable to them that you'd be getting that exposure. I mean that's the most intense those guys. Yeah, it's wild. Uh, and they're very good guys. Boy, are they surfing surfing the wave. What's WTF? [Music]"

    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] I thought we could use today to figure out a what is AI how did we get here what likely [Music] next as an Indian 20-year-old who wants to build a business in AI a career in AI what do we do today today like right now yeah hi Yan good morning and you care thank you for doing this pleasure the very first thing we like to do is get to know you a bit more uh how you came to be what you are today uh could you tell us a little bit about where you were born where you grew up leading up to today so I I grew up near Paris uh in the suburbs um my dad was an engineer and I learned learned almost everything from him um and um um always was interested in in science and technology since I was a little kid and and always saw myself as uh perhaps becoming an engineer I had no idea how you became a scientist U but I became interested in this afterwards what's the difference between an engineer and a scientist well um it's very difficult to to Define and uh very fun you have to be a little bit of both M but but uh um scientists you try to understand the world um engineer you try to create new things and very often if you want to understand the world you need to create new things the progress of science very much is linked with progress in technology that allows to collect data you know the invention of the telescope allow the discovery of planets and the planets are um rotating around the Sun and things like this right the microscope will open the door to all kinds of things so um so technology enables science and for the problem that really has been my obsession for a long time is uh discovering the mysteries of uncovering the mysteries of intelligence um and as as an engineer I think the the only way to do this is to build a machine that is intelligent right so there's both an aspect of the scientific aspect of understanding intelligence what it is um at a theoretical level and more practical side of things and then U of course the consequences of building intelligent machines could be could have you know could be really important for Humanity and school in Paris studying what so I I studied electrical engineering um but as I progressed in my studies I became more and more interested in sort of more fundamental questions in mathematics physics and and AI um I I did not study computer science right of course there is always computers involved when you studied electrical engineering even in the 1980s and late 70s actually when I started um but um but I got to do a few independent projects with mathematics professors on on the questions of AI and and and things like that and I really got hooked into research I was uh um you know my my uh my my favorite activity is to to build new things invent new things and then understand new things in a new way when somebody says Goda of AI the term how does it make you feel what do you think about it uh I mean I don't particularly like this term you know I I live in New Jersey Godfather in New Jersey means you are you belong to the mafia right I mean science is never a sort of individual uh Pursuit you you you make progress by by the Collision of ideas from multiple people and you you you make you do make hypothesis and then you try to show that your hypothesis is is correct by demonstrating that the idea you have the mental model of what should work um is correct by demonstrating that uh that it works um or doing some Theory and things like that and um it it's not an isolated uh activity so there's always a lot of people who have contributed to to progress but then because of the nature of how the world works we only remember just a few people um I think a lot of the credit should go to a lot more people it's just that we don't have a good you know memory for attributing credit to to a lot of people so how does it feel to be a teacher today on when you were at NYU are you the celebrity at NYU um let's say over the last uh several years uh students come up to me at the end of the class I want to take selfies yeah so so there's a little bit of that I I think um if you are in the same room with someone I think it's important to sort of uh make the session interactive because otherwise you can just watch a video so so that's why yeah that's what I try to do really sort of engage Eng with the students do you suspect being a hero in Academia in research is much like being a hero in sport or entrepreneurship or do you think it's harder okay there's something I'm I'm happy about the fact that there can be heroes you know from in science um arue there was newon and Einstein and all these people well Newton was not really kind of a public figure I I think um I mean was Cambridge but Einstein certainly was yeah um and to some extent you know other some other scientists also were were sort of minor celebrities um so I mean I think uh some of that comes from you know scientific production but frankly there's a lot of people who have made scientific contributions that are completely unknown um and which I find it a little sad but um I I think a lot of people who have become prominent in in in science and technology is not just because of the science they've they've produced but also because of their public stands and um out there you know what one one thing that perhaps differentiates me from other scientists who are a little quieter is that I'm very present on social networks and I give public talks and I have strong opinions about not just technical issues but also uh policy issues to some extent so I that that I think amplifies a little bit the yeah the popularity or unpopularity in certain circles I'm seen like a complete idiot I've watched a lot of your interviews over the last fortnite last month in fact if you were to state three problems with the world from Yan's lens what would they be um so as as a scientist you try to establish causal models of the world right so there are effects that we're seeing and then the question is what is it cause by and almost for almost every problem that we have the the uh the cause is really a lack of knowledge or or intelligence by humans we're making mistakes we're missing mistakes because we're not smart enough to figure out we have a problem because we're not smart enough to figure out Solutions we are smart enough to organize ourselves to find Solutions right so things like I mean climate change is a huge issue right um and you know there might there are you know political issues with that and um questions of organizing uh the world the governments Etc but also uh potentially technological solutions to to climate change and and I wish we were you know smarter so that we could find Solutions faster so are you saying humans don't know why we do what we do and that's the problem no I think the mistakes we're making is because um uh if we were if we were a little smarter if we had a better mental model of of Father World Works uh and that's a central question in AI as well I think we could we could solve our our problems better we would take decisions that are more rational um and what I the the the the big issue I see in the world today is is is people who um are not interested in finding the facts and not interested in educating themselves um or maybe they are but they don't have the means to do this they don't have access to information and knowledge so I think the best thing we can do and maybe that's why you know I became a professor is to uh make people smarter and to some extent that's the best reason also to work on AI because AI is going to amplify human intelligence I mean the the overall intelligence of humanity if you want so I I think that uh that's the key to solving a lot of the problems that we have so just to prease this conversation uh I'm an idiot when it comes to anything around AI or technology there isn't much that I know and I've tried to learn uh over the past over over the very recent past and uh I have a lot of curiosity for it but I don't know enough about it a lot of the people watching us today are wnab be entrepreneurs primarily based out of India a lot of us have heard conjecture around AI we have heard about the edge cases both on the positive side and the negative side I thought we could use today to figure out for all of us a what is AI how did we get here and what likely next if I were to break today down into three parts should we start with what is AI okay um that's a good question what is intelligence even um so in the history of AI I think the problem of what is AI feels a little bit like the the story of the blind man with the elephant right uh that there are very different aspects to intelligence and over the history of AI people have addressed one view of what intelligence is and and and basically ignored all the other all the other aspects so um one of the early aspects of uh of intelligence that people address with AI in the 1950s was you know intelligence is about reasoning um how do we reason so how do we reason logically um how do we search for solutions to a new problem and in the 50s people figured out um when we have a problem let's say that's become a startup problem in U in AI it's or computer science now um you know I give you a bunch of cities and I ask you you have to go through every single City and what's the shortest path the the shorter circuit to go around the city that's called a traveling salesman problem um and they say like every reasoning can be formulated in terms of searching for a solution to a problem there's a space of possible solution there is something that tells you whether you found a good solution or not or or some number that tells you the length of the path and you just have to search for the shortest path right and and to some extent you could reduce every reasoning problem to a problem of of this type in mathematics we call this optimization okay so you have um a problem you can you can evaluate whether your problem is solved or not with a number that indicates you know it's low if your length of your path is small and it's high if it's longer and you search for a solution that minimizes that uh that say finding Solutions related to intelligence if you were to ask me what is intelligence I would be like dumbfounded in trying to Define it in a sentence right I mean so that comes back to the elephant analogy can you explain the elephant analogy well so you know the the blind the the blind man in the elephant right so you the first blind goes to the side of the elephant say that sounds like a looks like a wall and then one goes to a leg that looks like a tree um and another one you know touches the trunk that's a that's a pipe and nobody has a complete picture of what an elephant is right and you you see it from from the various angles so this aspect of intelligence as being a search for a solution to a particular problem is you know a small piece of the elephant it's it's one aspect of intelligence but it's not it's not the entire thing but in the 50s um one branch of of AI was basically only concerned by this um and and that Branch was essentially dominant until until the 1990s um that that AI uh consist in searching for solution for plans you know if you want to you know stack a bunch of objects on top of each other and some objects are bigger than others you have to sort of organize the order in which you're going to stack the objects you know you search for a sequence of actions to arrive at a goal that's called planning or even um let's say you have a robot arm and you have to grab an object but there is there's you know obstacles in front of it you have to plan a trajectory for the arm to grab to grab the object um so all of that is planning that's part of this searching for a solution to a problem um but that part of AI which again was started in the 50s and was dominant until the '90s uh completely ignored things like perception like how do we understand the world how do we recognize an object um how do we separate an object from its background so we can identify it um and um you know how how how do we think um not in terms of logic or or or search but perhaps in more abstract uh abstract terms and so that was essentially ignored but there was another branch of a I also started in the 50s um that said well let's try to reproduce the mechanisms of intelligence that that we see in animals and humans and animals and humans have brains um the brains basically organize themselves they they learn right they they're not spontaneously smart and the intelligence is sort of emerging emerging phenomenon of networks of very simple elements in large numbers that are connected with each other um so in the 50s 40s people started discovering that intelligence and and memory comes from the strength of the connections between neurons in a sort of simplified Manner and the way the brain learns is by modifying the strengths of the connections between neurons so so some people came up with sort of theoretical models and and actually electronic circuits that reproduce this you know can we build intelligence you're saying was largely the ability to solve a certain problem so that's the first view right to solve particular problems that that that were given the second one is the ability to learn right okay and that created those two branches of AI right um so the the the one that started with the ability to learn um there was some success in the late 50s early 60s and it died in the late 60s because uh the type of learning procedures uh for for those neural networks that people devised in the in the 60s turned out to be extr limited you there was no way you could use this to produce truly intelligent machines but it had a lot of consequences in various parts of engineering uh a field of engineering called pattern recognition um so you're saying now that intelligence is the ability of a system to learn as well the to learn and and the simplest situation in which you need machines to learn is for perception interpreting um images interpreting sounds and what did computers use to do that so for that it's it's basically what caused the emergence of what we could call classical computer science okay you write a program and that program basically internally searches for a solution and has some way of checking whether the solution it it proposes is good or not um people had a name for this in the 60 they call this heris programming because you can't you can never exhaustively search all solutions for a good one because a number of solution is ridiculously large you know at chess for example right you you can play a certain number of moves but then for every move that you play your opponent can play a certain number of moves and then for every of those moves you can play a certain number of moves so you get this exponential explosion of the number of possible trajectories basically or sequences of moves and uh you cannot possibly explore all of them until the end of the game to figure out which move to uh to play first so so you have to use what you know what's called heuristics to to basically not search the entire graph or tree of possibilities so we'll put up a graph explaining this but what you're saying in herotic AI is you would have a user who would put in an input there would be a bunch of rules and you would use like a tree search or a expert AI which would run a function like if this then that if not then this to try and get to an end State yeah so something that would but a defined end state be defined and and the the program will be completely return by a person um and uh and the the difference between a good and a bad system would be in how uh smart the system is in in searching for good solution without doing exhaustive search okay that's theistic part of it um a slightly different approach is the one that's based on logic right so you have rules and facts what other facts can you deduce from the from the existing fact and the rules which would be logical formula and things like this that was you know pretty dominant in the 1980s um and that led to a um an area of uh of AI called expert systems or world based systems um to some extent is very connected with this idea of search okay and then in parallel to this there is the bottom up uh approach you know let's try to reproduce the to some and get inspiration from the the basic mechanisms of intelligence in biology Implement um allow machines to learn and basically organize themselves um with the idea that how would you do that so so it's based on the same idea that neuroscientists figured out was going on in the brain which is that the learning mechanism in the brain proceeds by modification of the strength of the connections between neurons right um and and and people imagine that know this type of learning could um actually be reproduced in machines so first it was the idea that you could you know that neurons were simple simple computational elements there were proposal around those lines in the 1940s by mathematicians like M and pitz and people like that and then in the 50s um and early 60s people proposed a very simple algorithm to change the strength of the connections between neurons so that they could on a task um so the first machine of this type was called the perceptron and it was proposed in 1957 it's a very simple thing and it's very simple to understand um let's say you want to train a system to recognize simple shapes um images okay what is an image for a computer or for a artificial system it's a it's an array of numbers um we know that today because we're familiar with digital cameras and pixels right so um let's take a a black and white camera a pixel um is if the pixel is black it's a zero if it's white it's a one okay so you can take only two values black or white um if you want to build this with 1950s technology you would put an array of photo sensors photo cells right with with a lens in front of them and you would show an image very low resolution maybe 20 x 20 pixels or something like this or even lower um so now that gives you an array of numbers that you can fit to a computer but what they did in 1950s computers were incredibly expensive so they actually built electronic circuits so the the pixels were voltages um coming out of the photo sensors um and then you want to train a system to recognize simple shapes let's say distinguish the shape of a c from the shape of a d uh drawn on this uh on this array um so you show an example of a c and then you let the system produce an output this output will also be a voltage and the way the output is going to be computed is a weighted sum of the of the values that come in of the pixels that are one or zero the weights are connections to a simulated neuron which is just an electronic circuit that computes you know if it's a if it's a one or a zero I'm going to multiply this one or Z by a weight which is like a resistor that you can change the value of okay and then um all of the pixels with their weight are going to be summed up if the weighted sum is larger than the threshold it's a c if it's lower than that threshold it's a d all right what era was this which year did you see 1957 um so now how do you train this so training consists in changing the value of those weights you can have positive or negative weights um and what you do is you show a C and system confutes the weighted sum so for a c you want the weighted sum to be large larger than zero let's say okay and let's say it's smaller than zero so the system made a mistake so you tell it no it should be larger okay you press a button basically and you tell it I really want the output to be to be bigger so what the system does is that it changes all the weights that get a one so it increases them a little bit if you increase all the weights they get a one one the weighted sum increases right and if you keep if you keep doing this changing the weights just a little bit every time eventually the weighted sum is going to go above zero and then the system will recognize this as a c and what did we use this for back in the 50s and 60s so nothing really very practical other than recognizing simple shapes okay um so you you you repeat showing a c and a d and for for the C you say increase the weighted Su for the is a decrease of weighted sum so decrease of Weights that have a one increase of Weights that have a zero and then eventually the system settles on the configuration of Weights so that when you show a c it's above the threshold when you show a d is is below the threshold so it can distinguish the two and what it's going to do is you know give a positive weight to the pixels that only appear for the C and A negative weight to the pixels that only appear for the D and that will sort of discriminate between those two so we had we had htics AI expert AI trying to mimic biology all of this in the ' 50s and ' 60s in the 50s yeah starting in the ' 50s and then you know two different branches basically competing with each other and they tried to kind of um so one person a prominent figure in um in AI the pioneering days is Marvin Minsky he was a professor at MIT he has a Marvin there is a I remember reading about this there's a Marvin clause or debate or something like that right um well he was uh he had pretty strong opinions about things so there was a lot of discussions um and is interesting because he started his PhD in the 50s trying to build neuron net and then completely changed his mind MH and and and became uh basically a big advocate for the other approach the the more logic based and search approach and in the late 60s or mid 60s he wrote a book Co wrote a book with uh sour pepper was a mathematician in MIT um whose title was perceptron and the whole book was to do some theory about perceptron and to show that the cap the capabilities of the perceptron was limited so the people who are working on their net at the time kept working onet but they changed the name of what they were doing they called it statistical pattern recognition which sounds much more serious or adaptive filter Theory which also sounds very serious and those had enormous application in the world in my world it's always been I work in finance and hedge funds and fund managers have always been attempting to pump a lot of data into a neural network to recognize patterns right is it the same thing that we're talking about an evolution from the 50s yeah absolutely um I mean the process I describe of changing coefficients you know up or down to get the output you you want uh you could think of the this as a iterative process very similar to linear regression which if you work in fance you probably know that uh so but what I've realized Jan is it's even today uh it's very easy to tweak data that you have collected retrospectively to make something appear like it makes sense but Financial activity tends to be so random that I don't know if you can build a model based on that right so the um well that that addresses a bigger issue when you when you train a system this way right so the the generic principle which is called supervisor rning is U you give an input to the system it produces an output if the output is not the one you want uh you adjust the coefficient so that the output gets closer to the one you want okay and there are efficient ways to figure out how to tweak the parameters so that the output gets closer to the one you want and if you keep doing this on hundreds thousands millions billions of examples eventually this system if it's powerful enough we'll figure it out now the problem with the perceptron is that the type of functions input output functions that was accessible to perceptron was very limited MH so there was no way you could take a natural image uh you know a photo uh uh and and train the system to tell you if there is a dog or a cat or a table in it right that was just not possible the system was not able to um was not powerful enough to really compute this kind of complex function uh this is what neural Nets and deep learning changed in the 1980s and the what just before you get into neural Nets if I'm trying to paint the entirety of the picture would you say there is Intelligence on top artificial intelligence and below that is machine learning and neural Nets are a part of machine learning yeah so in terms of fields and subfields AI is more of a problem than a solution okay it's a field of investigation and then there is different techniques you can use for that right so there is something that jokingly is referred to as good oldfashioned AI GOI which is using logic and search and her istic programming and things like this which is this is what you will find in sort of standard textbooks on on AI then there is machine learning so there the idea is you don't completely program a machine to do something you you train it from data that means you need data within this there is a subcategory equal deep learning and this is what the reason why we hear so much about here in the last Dozen Years is because of deep learning and neuron Nets is really the ancestor of deep learning deep learning is a new name for it if you want um um and and then there is you know application areas um so below that below that so and and they can use combinations of those techniques right so so big applications are computer vision interpreting images uh speech recognition natural language understanding um and maybe speech synthesis also can be viewed as part of this Al is more connected with signal processing uh and then you know various other applications so in you know time series prediction or financial modeling and things like this you know could be seen as part of this so if you had to so I'm I'm breaking it down AI has GOI under it which is traditional in nature like you explained then machine learning yes can you define GOI in a simple uh on line definition so GOI is the the descendant of uh the the what I was describing earlier as searching for Solutions right this idea that it's all about reasoning reasoning is all about search uh you know looking for a solution to a problem and having a way of characterizing whether you found a solution so you mean the rule based thing input in an output based on what applies the what rule applies like that um the the um yeah I mean any any world based system anything that uses logical inference MH um deducing facts from rules and previous facts searching for a solution like finding the shortest path in a you know in a graph or something um those are good old fashion Ai and under machine learning what are the different types of ml so so there is uh So-Cal traditional machine learning I'm not sure that deserves the term and this is basically derived from uh statistical estimation so things like linear regression we be part of it and then there are other methods slightly more uh sophisticated uh uh boosting um classification trees super Vector machines kernel methods I mean there there's a bunch of methods of this type and B in inference that are part of machine learning in the sense that they they obey that model of you know you you you build a program but the program is really not finished it's got a bunch of tunable parameters and the input output function is determined by the value of those parameters and so you train the system from data using this iterative um adjustment techniques that I described before show examples if the answer is incorrect adjust the parameters so that it it comes closer to the answer you want so machine learning is supervised in a way so that's supervised running okay you you tell the system here is an output here is the desired desired output M um but there are other forms of learning so one one different form is uh reinforcement learning so in reinforcement learning you don't tell the system the correct answer you just tell it whether the answer it produced was good or bad you give you give it a single number that tells it your answer was good or was bad and what happens next say I'm a reinforcement learning engine and you tell me an answer was good or bad what do I do next well so if your answer was good um you don't do much if your answer was bad then uh you have to figure out which answer among all the possible answer that could have produced which one would be a better one so maybe you try another answer and you say what about this one is it better or is it worse uh if the environment tells you it was better then you kind of deemphasize the first one and emphasize that one by tuning the parameters inside of an Internet or something like that some sort of learning uh learning machine so what is self-supervised learning okay so self-supervised learning is what has become very prominent over the last five six years and um is is really the the the main component or the the main contribution to the success of things like chatbot natural uh language understanding systems they don't fall under reinfor enforcement learning no it's more similar to supervised running but the difference is that instead of having a clear input and output and training the system to produce the output from the input um you basically only have things that can either be input and output let me take an example um you take a a piece of text and you corrupt that text in some way so by removing some words right so now you have a partially masked uh text where some words are missing and you train the machine to predict the words that are missing so the technique you would use for this is supervisor running because you tell the system here is the correct word that you should predict at that location MH um and the system can use all the words that it can see to predict the words that he cannot see and this is an example for supervised learning self-supervised learning it's self-supervised because the there is no differentiation between input and output it's really kind of the same thing and if the input is for example an image the the way you um you would train a self supervis rning system is that you would corrupt or transform the image in some way and then you would train the system to recover the original image from the corrupted or transform version of it okay so there's no supervision you don't need someone to go through a few million images and labeling them is it a cat or a dog or a table or a chair um it's it's it's a task of basically understanding the the input uh the internal structure of the input by being able to fill in the to fill in the blanks forgive me for asking maybe a really stupid question I'm trying to picture this let's say I have X amount of data I have 10 lines that say cats are black dogs a white whatever 10 lines I remove a part of it and then I tell the model to fill it in yeah are you saying at that point of time I also tell the model the answer saying this should be the answer yeah you you you tell it here is the answer that I removed like can you predict this missing can you arrive at the answer which I removed and I'm telling you that this was the answer right but you can only use the thing that you can see so you don't see the answer on the input you have to predict it but I'm telling you when during training I tell you what it is and so the system can adjust its parameter to its parameters in a supervised fashion so the the only differ the difference is not in the algorithms themselves it's basically supervis running but it's in the structure of the system and the way the data is uh is is used and and and produce you you don't need to basically have uh you know someone going through millions of images and telling you uh this is a cat or a dog a table um you just show an image of a dog a cat or a table and you corrupt it partially change it change the colors maybe or something and then ask the system to recover the original one from the corrupted one okay so that's that's uh one particular form of self supervising and this is what's been incredibly successful for natural language understanding so things like so chatbots are or llms large language models are a special case of that where you train a system to predict a word but you only allow it to look at the words the the words that preced it um you know that are to the left of it um and that requires kind of building the neuronet in a particular way so that the connections that that predict one word only look at the the words that precede so then you don't need to corrupt the input you just show an input and through the structure of the system the system can only predict can only is trained to predict the next word from from from the content and these are all examples of neural networks in a way these are all underlying this are particular way of connecting neural network neurons with each other simulated neurons right uh or or simple elements that compute a very simple mathematical function something like a weighted sum and what's adjustable are the weights or in the case of uh Transformer architectures which are are very uh popular at the moment um uh they consist in basically comparing every input to each other and and producing weights uh I I could explain this it's a little more complicated but what is a Transformer so okay so there are several Architectural Components uh which from which you can build a neural net so let me start with um very simple idea let's say you want to build a neural net that recognizes images okay so again an image is an array of numbers indicating the brightness of every pixel right um You can build a neural network with a single layer so let's say you want to distinguish um 10 categories okay cats dogs tables and chairs and cars and whatever um or let's say it's simpler you want to recognize the 10 digits okay 0 to9 U someone drawing a digit it's drawn on a 16 x 16 pixel area so you have 250 256 inputs and you have 10 outputs okay you can have a single what's called a single layer on your net uh which basically each output is a weighted sum of of the pixels and you try to train those weights in such a way that when you show a zero the output zero is the most active and the other ones are less active and and so forth for all the categories okay that may work for simple shapes like like printed uh digits it won't work for handwriting because there's so much variability in the characters that you cannot reduce the classification to a simple weighted sum okay so the Breakthrough that occurred in the 1980s was to um stack multiple layers of neurons so each Neuron computes a weighted sum and then passes this weighted sum through essentially a threshold function so if the weighted sum is below a threshold the the neuron stays inactive the output is zero and if it's above a threshold it's active okay there's various ways to do this um but it's nonlinear and that's very important so you stack two layers where um the the middle layer you could think of as detecting sort of basic motifs on the inputs and then the second layer sort of integrate those motifs to figure out okay this is a a c because it's got two n points you know the the uh the shape of the C kind of stops there and I can detect that so if there's two of them that's a c and a d doesn't but a c has two corners maybe I can detect that the system spontaneously learns to do this from end to end and and the way it works is through an algorithm called back propagation um and what this back propagation algorithm does is that when you show an image of a C and you tell the system this is a c so activate this output neuron does not and do not activate the other ones it knows how to adjust the parameter so that the output gets closer to the one you want um and that's done by propagating signals backwards to um to basically figure out the sensitivity of each output to um to to each weight so that you can change the weights in such a way that the good output increases and the bad outputs decrease right um so that's back propagation that um um algorithms to do this so the back propagation algorithm popped up in the 1980s conceptually it existed before but people didn't realize they could use it for machine learning and there was a wave of interest in neuron Nets starting in the mid mid mid 80s lasting 10 15 years um to kind of exploit this idea of multilayer networks and this was crucial because it it lifted some of the limitations that Minsky and paper in the 60s said were you know the percep one was the was subjected to um so a big wave of interest but then people realize that to train those neuron Nets um you need a lot of data and this was before the internet there was not much data you need fast computers and computers were not that fast um so so people kind of lost interest in a little bit in this but one thing that I worked on in the late 80s early 90s is um if you want a system of this type to recognize images you can have to connect the neurons to each other in a particular way that facilitates the system soort of paying attention you know being able to detect motives for example right local motives so um I got inspiration from biology again um a classical work in Neuroscience that that went back to the 1960s to basically organize the way the neurons are connected to each other into layers uh so that they bias towards kind of finding good solutions for image recognition so that's called a convolutional neural network or conet um so just just to come back to this where you are like so you broke down machine learning I'm sorry I keep going back sure or I'll get confused yes so under machine learning the really popular pathway right now let's say self-supervised which has chapped GPD and a bunch of other things what's happening in the reinforcement learning space so not So Much Anymore um there was a big wave of interest in reinforcement learning um about you know a dozen years ago and companies like deep M set themselves up with the idea that reinforcement learning was going to be the the key element towards building truly intelligent machines mhm can you again like Define reinforcement learning once more in a line so reinforcement learning is a situation where you don't tell the system what the correct answer is you just tell it whether the answer it produced was good or bad right okay okay so there are many possible answers it's very inefficient because the system has to try many things before it gets the correct answer um and so it's very inefficient it requires many many many trials and so it works really well for games you know you you it's very efficient if you want to train a system to play chess or go or things like that poker reinforcement learning is great because you can have the system play millions of games against itself or copies of itself and it can adjust it you know it wins or loses a game so it can you know it knows which policy which flavor of the neuronet won the game and sort of reinforces that and deemphasizes the one that lost and so the system basically can train itself right and what did you say a Transformer was okay so I was coming to this you know through commercial net right so there is this uh um particular way of connecting simility neurons with each other to bias it towards doing a good job for certain types of data and uh conval Nets are really good for uh data that comes from the natural world whether it's an image or an audio signal um which are things that are um where where nearby values in the array of numbers that come to you in an image or audio signal nearby values are generally very similar to each other so if you take a picture any picture natural image and you take two neighboring pixels they're very likely to have the same the same color or the same intensity now what I'm talking about here is the fact that the you know natural data like images and audio and just about any natural signal has some natural underlying structure to it um and if you build the neural net in a particular way that that can take advantage of this structure it it will learn faster it will learn with fewer samples so we started doing doing experiments with this in the late 80s and and and build those comption Nets they are inspired by the architecture of the visual cortex really um and there's some mathematical justification for it but the the basic idea is that um each neuron in a conval net only looks at a small area of the image and and you have multiple neurons looking at multiple areas of the image and they all do the same thing they all have the same weights um it's a basic concept which connects with mathematical concept called convolutions and so that's why those things are called convolution Nets okay so that's what's called an architectural component or a module a convolution is something that has an interesting property which is that if you show it an input it's going to produce a particular output if you shift the input the output will be shifted but otherwise unchanged and that's a very interesting property for audio signals images and various other natural signals okay now a Transformer is a different way of arranging the the the neurons uh if you will in such a way that um the the inputs are a number of different items we call them tokens they're really vectors which means list of numbers okay and the property of a uh the layer or the block of a transformer is that if you permute the inputs the output will be permuted similarly but otherwise unchanged um when you say otherwise unchanged you mean you mean I what I mean is that um if you you give a bunch of tokens you run through the Transformer you will get a bunch of output tokens okay the same number generally as the number of input tokens there'll be different vectors um if you now take the first half and the second half of of your sequence of input tokens and you flip them what you will get is the same result that you got previously but it will be flip exactly the same way okay so the input output function is uh technically we call this equivariant to permutation so it basically views the inputs as a set in which the order of the object does not matter okay um Comal Nets on the other hand view the input as as something where an object could appear at any location on the input and it shouldn't make any difference to the output or the output should change but otherwise I mean should shift but otherwise stay on change that's equivariance to translation now when you build a neural net you basically combine components of this type so that you get the the property you want out of the entire neural net so you combine things like convolutions and Transformer blocks what is convolution yeah I'm sorry I'm going to ask you like to simplify every single term oh absolutely so convolution is this component for a comol neuron net so the idea of it is that you have a neuron that looks at at a part of the input and then you have another neuron that looks at another part of the input but it computes the same function as the first neuron and then you replicate that same neuron for every location on the input so that um you can think of each of those neurons as detecting a particular Motif on a part of the input and all the neurons detecting the same Motif at different parts of the input so that now if you take an input and and you shift it the you're going to get the same output shifted because you know you're going to have the same neurons looking detecting the same Motif just at different locations so that that's what gives you this shift equivariance um that's a convolution mathematically there's something called a convolution that mathematicians invented a long time ago and that's basically what this what this does when you say neuron in all of this can you explain the basis of just that term what is it so uh we we we use that term it's an abusive language because those neurons are not really neurons like in the brain they're they are to real neurons as an airplane wing is to a bird wing okay M so it performs the same it has the same concept and what a neuron does in a neuronet is Computing a weighted sum of its inputs and then comparing that withed some to a threshold activating the output if it's above the threshold and and producing zero if it's below the threshold that's the the basic neuron now there are variations of this and in a Transformer it's a slightly different type of mathematics you can comparing vectors to each other and things like that but uh but that's kind of the basic functionality of a neuron It's a combination of a linear operation where you have coefficients that you can change the value of through training and then a nonlinear uh function a threshold or something like that that uh you know detects something or not right we looked online and while we were researching we could not find a good definition for neural network language model and how it works in simple terms okay um so the idea of a language model goes back to the 1940s a gentleman called Claude Shannon he's a very famous uh mathematician who used to work at bz where I used to work um although he wasn't there anymore when I joined uh and he he came up with a theory called information Theory and then was fascinated by the idea that you could discover the structure in data right so he invented something where you take a text um and and you say I'm give you a I'm giving you a sequence of letters and I'm asking you what is the next letter that comes afterwards okay so let's take a you know English word um or whatever in in the sort of uh let's say you know Roman language if you have a series of letters and the last one is a q it's very likely that the next letter is a u you almost never have a q without you behind it unless it's an Arabic word or something that's been translator right um so for every every letter that you observe you can you can build a table of the probability that the next letter will be an a a b a c this is where the word generative comes from yeah so it's generative because if you have this table of conditional what we call conditional probabilities right given the previous letter what is the next what is the probability of the next letter you can use this to generate text you you start with a letter let's say Q okay and then you look through the table probability what's the next letter that is most likely you just pick that one that's going to be you mhm um or you don't pick that one you you you pick the next letter with the probability that is you know you flip a coin or you generate a random number in the computer and then you you produce the you know the following letter according to the probabilities that you measured on real text um and you keep doing this and the system is going to just generate letters um it's not going to look like Words mhm uh it's probably not even going to be pronounceable right um but that if instead of a context of one letter you take a context of two letters then it becomes kind of more readable it's still not words right if you take a context of three letters then it it becomes you know even nicer and as you increase the size of the context that determines the the probability of the next letter it becomes more and more readable but you have an issue there which is that um uh the the size of the table you need if you have if you look at the first letter and and and and you have to figure out what's the probability for the next letter you need a table of 26 rows and 26 columns for each first letter what is the probability for every possible second letter right so it's table 26 by 26 now if you the context has two letters now the number of rows in your table is 26 squared because you have 26 squared sequences of two possible sequences of two letters right and for each of those you need 26 probabilities so it's 26 Cube the side of your table as you add characters um the table increases to 26 to the^ n when n is the length of the of of the uh of the sequence so that's called an NR model and that's a language model you can do this at the level of characters it's more difficult to do this at the level of a word because you might have 100 thousand possible words right so now your table is gigantic MH so you can train a word model or or language model by by just filling up this table of probabilities by training on a large Corpus of text uh but it becomes impractical above a certain length of context number of the amount of compute and work required is it's also it's the memory of storing all those tables and uh also the fact that um those tables are going to be very sparely populated because you can have billions of words of text most combinations of words don't appear some them are extremely rare and so you cannot estimate the probability properly okay so is this a part of self supervised learning so you could think of this as an instance of self supervis running because you only need sequences of symbols and it doesn't matter where they come from and you don't they don't necessarily come from Human uh production if they're not text if it you know it could be for example uh a sequence of frames for a video right I mean you would have to turn it into discrete objects which of course doesn't is difficult but um uh but it's you know whatever data comes to you so uh in the late 90s um some people had the idea that in particular y Benjo the idea that you could use a neural net to to do this prediction instead of filling up tables with conditional probabilities that you measure from text just train a noral net to predict the next word okay give it a context of words and just train it to produce a proba distribution over the next word and he experimented with this with you know neuron Nets that were big for the time but small by today standards and one difficulty was you cannot exactly predate what word is going to come next so you have to produce a probability over all the words and there's maybe 100,000 words in a typical um uh language and so that means you're you need to Output 100,000 scores one for each word that indicates with which probability that word follows the the previous sequence of words um so it demonstrated that that that could work and you know even with the computers of the time it was kind of challenging but but but it could work and then the idea was kind of revived more recently um and it turned out that if you use those Transformer architectures which I didn't explain uh and you you train them on basically the entirety of all the public available text on the internet um and you you build the architecture of those system so that it's trained to you know take a context of words and predict the next word um and if you make the context potentially very large something like a few thousand a few tens of thousands or even a million words then you get system that seem to have emerging property that they can answer questions they can you know if you make them really big they have so many parameters that are adjustable they have they may have tens of billions or hundreds of billions of parameters that gives them a large amount of memory and they they they seem able to store a lot of knowledge about the the data they me train on if it's text they will regate solutions to puzzles they will you know give you answers to um to questions you may have it's mostly retrieval there's a very tiny bit of reasoning but really not much uh and that's an important limitation but it's still surprising how well those things work and it's um you know what people got really surprised about is that those systems can manipulate language um in ways that are uh very impressive right I mean humans have pretty limited in our way with medip language and and those things seem to be really good at it I mean they capture grammar and you know syntax and everything in multiple languages right that's pretty amazing so if I were to like go back and paint a tree so let's say AI on top machine learning under it I'm talking about what is making the news today and what everybody is so excited about machine learning has different things different neural networks under it there's a reinforcement one like deep mind there is a self-supervised generative chat GPT because using it as a placeholder as it's the most popular one right now LM huh llm Auto regressive LM really that's what it should be called Auto regressive yeah I mean the the the proper organization is yeah there is AI at the top uh machine learning is a particular way of approaching the AI problem under this is deep learning which is really the the the foundation of pretty much all of AI today um so basically neural networks with multiple layers right so the idea of this goes back to the 1980s and back propagation that's still the the the basic Foundation of everything we do and this there is several families of architectures convolutional Nets Transformers combinations thereof um then there is under Transformers there is several um flavors of it some of which can be applied to image recognition or audio some of which can be applied to representing natural language but not generating it and then there's a subcategory large language models which are Auto regressive Transformers so Transformers have a particular architecture that uh allow them to predict the next word and you can you you can use it to just generate word because you know given a sequence of word has been trained to produce the next word so given a text you have produce an X word and then you shift the input by one so now the word it generated is part of its input and you can ask it to generate the second word shift that third word shift that fourth word that's Auto regressive prediction it's the same concept as auty models in finance and econometrics and stuff like that same stuff and these work best for text but not for pictures videos or any of that that's right and the reason it works for text and not for other things is because text is discrete so there is a finite number of possible things that can happen right there's a finite number of words in the dictionary there a you know so if you can discretize your signal then you can use those Auto regressive prediction systems and the you know the main the main issue is that um you're never going to be able to make an exact prediction MH and so the system is going to have to learn U some sort of probability distribution or at least you know produce scores that are different for for uh for different potential outputs so you can output a list of probabilities if you have a finite number of possibilities which is the case for language um but if you want to predict what's going to happen in a video the number of possible frames video frames is essentially infinite right you you have you know let's say a million pixels right an image thousand by thousand pixels pixels are in colors you have three values so that's 3 million values um that you have to produce and and we don't know how to represent a probability distribution over the set of all possible images with 3 million pixels but this is what everybody's very excited about this is what a lot of us consider the next challenge in AI so basically have systems that can learn how the world Works uh by watching videos and if you were to say videos learn from videos and pictures which will be the next phase where does that fall in this entire equation does it come under where llm sit today no it's completely different from llm which is why I've been U pretty vocal about the fact that llms are not the pass to human level intelligence um LMS work for discrete worlds they don't work for continuous s dimensional Words which is the the case for video and this is why llms do not understand the physical world um and and cannot be used in their current form to really understand the physical world and so we have I mean llms are amazing in their ability to manipulate language but they can make very very stupid mistakes that reveal they really don't understand how the world works right the underlying world and um this is why we have systems that can pass the bar exam or or write an essay for you but we don't have domestic robots we don't have cell driving cars or completely autonomous level five cell driving cars we we you know we don't have systems that really understand very basic things that your cat can understand so I've been yeah you know kind of vocal saying that you know the smartest llms are not as smart as your house cat yeah and it's really true so so the the challenge for the next few years is to build AI systems that lift the limitation of limitations of llm so systems that understand the physical world are have persistent memory which L really don't have at the moment persistent memory persistant memory which means you know they can remember things right store facts in a in a memory and then retrieve them when it's interesting um can't llms remember stuff now the only memory that an llm the only two there's two types of memory that LM has the first type is in the parameters in the coefficients that are adjusted during training right so they will learn something they it's not really kind of storing a piece of information if you train llm on a bunch of novels it cannot regurgitate the novels but it will remember something about the statistics of the words in that novel and it might be able to answer questions you know general questions about about the story and things like this but you're not going to be able to regate all the words right um kind of like humans right you read a novel you can't you can't remember all the words you you unless you spend a lot of efforts trying to do this uh so that's the first type of memory and then the second memory is the context the The Prompt that you type and since the system can generate word and and and those words are or those tokens are injected in its input it can use this as some sort of working memory but it's a very limited uh form of of memory what you want is a memory that would be more similar to what we have in our brains what molans have called the hippocampus um hippocampus is a kind of a brain structure in the center of the brain in Sol the cortex and if you don't have a hippocampus you can't remember things for more than about 90 seconds and if you were to draw a path from intelligence that we described on top all the way down to self-supervised learning how do you suspect that path will look towards as getting to the point where we are learning from videos and images and more humanlike intelligence so the the path that um I've been trying to to plot um is uh discovering new architectures different from those autoagressive architecture used for LM that would be applicable to to video so that self-supervised learning could be used to train those systems and this type of self supervis learning basically would be here is a piece of a video predict what comes next um and and if a system can do a good job at predicting what's going to happen next in a video that means it probably has understood a lot about the underlying structure of the world similarly to a large language model learns a lot about you know Language by just being trained to predict the next word right so not like I will understand but if you had to give us a line on how that architecture might look okay so here is the issue because as I told you um those autoaggressive architecture work for text because text is discreet MH and you can never predict the what what comes next we can produce a prob probability distribution over what comes next you cannot do this for images and video because it's just too complicated mathematically and you can show that it's intractable and blah blah blah so predicting all the pixels in a video that follow a particular video segment basically is not possible MH or not possible to a degree that would be useful for the problem that we're interested in you know what we want is ass that has the ability that uh the ability to predict what's going to happen in the world because that's a good way to for a system to be able to plan if I can plan that if I approach my hand you know to this glass um and I I close my hand and I lift it up you know I got to grab the glass and I can drink um I can plan a sequence of actions to arrive at a particular result right so you have a good model of the world that says the state of the world at time T is this the glasses on the table the action I'm going to take is close my hand around it okay um and lift what is going to be the state of the world at time t plus 3 seconds after I closed my hand and lifted my arm and the state of the world is going to be I'm going to have that glass in my hand um so if you have this kind of world model um state of the world action next state to the world then you can imagine you you can predict You can predict the outcome of a sequence of actions you can imagine taking a sequence of actions and then predict in your mind what the outcome will be You can predict if this outcome is something that satisfies a goal that you want to accomplish like drink a a little bit of water take a sip and what you can do is through search so now we're connecting with old AI search a sequence of actions that will actually satisfy this goal um so this is the type of um reasoning and planning that psychologist call system 2 okay Daniel kman is a late um Nobel prize winning psychologist um and he he makes this distinction between system one and system two where system one is actions you can take without thinking subconscious it's just reaction reactive and the system two is what you have to deliberately plan uh and think about to be able to uh produce an action or a sequence of actions so Yan will meor memory eventually be the answer cuz as humans from biology we learn through memory right well it depends what type of memory I mean we also have multiple types of memory we have the hippocampus that I I mentioned so hippocampus is used to store long-term memories like um you know things that happen to you when you were a child and things like that uh basic facts about the world like you know when you're mom was born or something um you know also you know which way you came in here so where's the door so this is more recent shortterm memory episodic memory working memory so if you're thinking about something you're kind of manipulating things in your head you have to kind of temporarily store uh data that's the hippocampus um and and your cortex does the computation and basically reads from this memory and updates it okay it's very much like a a bit of a computer where the cortex is the CPU and the hippocampus is the memory um that you read from and and write into U but the current design of AI systems is not like that so llms do not have a separate memory other than the prompt that you can generate token in uh and they don't have this ability to search through a set of answers for which one is the correct one although they're starting to have that to some extent so you may have heard of o1 from open and there is kind of similar work um at MAA and other places where um this sort of very basic forms of of reasoning that consist in having an llm produce lots of different sequences of uh of of words and then having a way of searching through this list of word which one is the best um but it's very inefficient so ultimately that's not what what you want so going back to the question of how do we get machines to learn by observing the world from learning from video we cannot use the architectures that are generative that just produce every pixel in the video that's just completely impractical and I've tried to do this for almost 15 years okay um and 5 years ago we came up with a different way of doing things that are called jeppa so it's a different architecture and that means joint embedding predictive architecture and what it means is I watched this for a long time on your Lex Freedman interview when you spoke about jepa and I still don't get it okay here's a basic idea tell me if you don't understand because I can explain it in different ways uh instead of taking a piece of video and training a bigor net to predict all the pixels of the continuation of that video you you you you take the the video and you run it to an encoder which is going to be a big Neal net that's going to produce an abstract representation of the video okay and then you take the reminder of the video the the the future you know the second half of that video run you to the same encoder and then you you train your prediction system which is similar perhaps to much like LM where you delete a part of the data to train the model that's right so you know an llm you you take a piece of text and you train it to predict the reminder of the text right and you do this word by word but you could do the you could predict multiple words so here we're going to do the same thing we're going to take a a video and then train a system to predict the reminder of the video but instead of predicting all the pixels in the video we're going to run those vide through encoders which are going to compute abstract representations of the video and we're going to do the prediction in that space of representations so instead of predicting pixels we predict abstract representations of those pixels where all the things that are basically unpredictable have been eliminated from from the representation so is that a bit like also predicting tomorrow cuz if I were to video my life up until now and run it through the en encoder it will give me some kind of representation of Tomorrow well yes but at an abstract level right so you can predict um you're basing in Bangalore and I I heard so at some point you're going to fly back to Bangalore uh and you can predict how long it's going to take to go back to Bangalore but you cannot predict all the details of what will happen uh during your your journey back to Bangalore exactly how long it's going to take given traffic how far can you extrapolate what will happen three months from now if I have data video data of the last 10 years of my life so here's the trick the is the interesting question you can predict very long term MH but the the longer in the future you can predict the more abstract the representation level at which you can make the prediction let me ask you a question if you were to extrapolate years forward all of our Lives you figure out how to build this architecture and it's implemented and it's working where video of our life up until now has been programmed into it and we're trying to predict 50 years forward what do you suspect you will see climate change in World War so what I'll see is okay so there is a a plan for the next few years to build systems I can't understand the world from video um perhaps what they'll be able to learn are those World models which are action condition so they they will be able to imagine what the consequence of an action or sequence of action will be they'll be perhaps able to plan complex sequences of action hierarchically because those World models will be hierarchical they will have World models that can predict really short term make accurate prediction but only in the short term like if I move my muscle in this particular way you know my arm is going to be in this particular location 100 millisecond from now that's really short range but very precise and then longer time prediction um if I go to the airport catch a plane I'll be in Paris tomorrow morning or you know if I study and I get good grades in college you know I can have a good life or something right uh so so you can make long-term prediction and and design plans that would satisfy certain criteria that that you have so if we can build AI were to predict the future would it be utopian or dystopian it would be utopian because it would be just a a an alternative way for predicting the future than our brains and for planning action sequences to satisfy certain conditions to achieve goals that is uh alternative to using our brains perhaps accumulating more knowledge to be able to do this and perhaps having abilities that humans don't have because of the limitations of our brain right computers can calculate and stuff like that right so so the the future is that if we succeed in this plan which may succeed within the next five or 10 years you know five to 10 years we have systems that as time goes by we can build up to become as intelligent as humans perhaps so reach human level intelligence within a decade that may be optimistic all right um 5 to 10 years would be if everything goes great all the plans that we we've been making will succeed we're not going to encounter unexpected obstacles but that is almost certainly not going to happen you don't like that right like AGI and human level intelligence you think is far far away or unlikely no I I don't think it's that far away I don't think my opinion about how far it is are very different from what you will hear from some Alman or deis or things like this um it's you know quite possibly within a decade but it's not going it's not going to happen next year it's not going to happen in two years it's going to it's going to take longer and so you don't want to extrapolate the capabilities of llm and and say we're just going to scale upm train them on with bigger computers and more data and you know human level intelligence is going to emerge this it's not going to work this way we're going to have to have those new architectures those jetas systems that learn from from The Real World um and can plan hierarchically uh can can plan a sequence of action you know as opposed to just producing one word after the other essentially without thinking so system two instead of system one llms are system one the architecture I'm describing which are called objective driven AI is system to I'd love to come like do a course at your college and learn if you'll have me as a student I don't know if I qualify I'll have to go back and finish high school but would would love it just to finish the llm loop so because it's in the news and everybody's talking about llms so you define a problem you find a large data set most of the time goes in cleaning the data you choose a model you train the model and then you execute the model uh before that you find tune the model before that you find tune model yes what will change here um so there's still going to be a need for collecting data and uh and filtering data to to to to keep high quality data and basically get rid of junk um that's actually a pretty expensive part of the whole thing but I think what's going to need to happen in that respect is that currently the the you know LMS are trained with a combination of publicly available data and Li data basically um but it's mostly publicly available data you know publicly available text on the internet right and it's extremely biased in many ways that um the the U A lot of it is in English um you know this you know significant amount of of data in in commonly spoken languages like Hindi but not so much in all 22 official languages of India and certainly not in all the 700 dialects or or whatever the number is particularly since most of those dicts are not written so only spoken so um what we need in the future is uh data sets that are more encompassing so that the the systems that are trained with it understand all the world's languages all the world's cultures all the value systems you know everything and no single entity I think would be able to to do this um which is why I think the future of AI is uh AI is going to become a a a kind of common infrastructure which people will use as repository of all human knowledge and this cannot be built by a single entity it's going to it's going to have to be a collaborative uh project right with training being distributed all around the world so that you can have models this trained on all data around the world but you don't have to copy the data anywhere and a private digression I was reviewing a data center business to invest into uh a lot of people tell me that compute as a commodity will soon be sold outside of the data center and not inherently in it is it a good place to focus energy and time on like building data centers out of India I'm taking the Sovereign AI model where every country will probably fight to retain their data a bit more than they're doing currently yeah so in in that kind of future which also I I alluded to with the distributed training of models uh having local comp Computing infrastructure I think is very important so yes I think that's kind of crucial it's crucial for two reasons one is uh having local ability to to train models okay and the second one is um having very lowcost access to inference for AI systems because if we want AI system to be used by I don't know 800 million Indians right um I know there are more Indians than this but most people you know not everybody will use AI systems but um it's a lot of computing infrastructure it's actually much bigger than the infrastructure for for learning um and there is this an area for which there is a lot more Innovation than than training training is dominated by Nvidia at the moment there's going to be other players but they they have a hard time U competing because of the software stack basically their Hardware may be really good but the software stack is uh is a challenge for influence though there's a lot more Innovation there and and that Innovation is bringing down the cost I think the cost of inference for llm has gone down by a factor of 100 in two years I mean it's amazing right it's way faster than Mor slow U and I think there is still a lot of room for improvements and you need that because you basically need the inference for a million tokens to be a few rupees um so so that's a big future if you want to deploy AI assistance widely in India I want to I want to use the time Yan cuz I realized we're running out to bring bring it into the Indian context are people watching this like I said are entrepreneurs in play or people trying to be entrepreneurs as an Indian 20-year-old who wants to build a business in AI a career in AI what do we do like as we sit today a 20-year-old U today I would cross my finger so that when I graduate at 22 uh there will be good PHD programs you know in India outside of the academic lens I I mean more no no but that that's that's what I need to train myself to innovate you know doing a PhD or gr grad studies it trains it trains you to invent new things and and also make sure that the methodology you use um prevent you you from from fooling yourself into thinking you're being in an innovator but you're not okay so you learn this what if I'm an entrepr rur a 25y old entrepreneur you still want to do a PhD if you're an entrepreneur or at least a masters because you want to really sort of learn deep I mean you might be doing this by yourself you don't have to but it's useful because you you learn more about you know what exists out there what's possible what's not possible what uh uh you get more uh legitimacy in hiring talented people I mean there's a lot of advantages you know particular in a complex deeply technical uh area like like AI um you might succeed if you don't you know that's not the issue but but it gives you kind of a different perspective okay but now you you know you're doing your PhD you're doing a startup it might be easier to raise money if you've published a few papers where you've invented something new and you say well this is a new technique that really may make a difference you know you go see an investor what what if I were to even like go one step further let's say intelligence I'm I'm going to leave the AGI side of it let's say narrow intelligence self-driving cars robots all of that what should I build in if I have to pick a subset where I can use narrow intelligence through any of the models that we spoke about what would I start which has a capitalistic leg to it okay so today today like right now yeah uh the the most likely business model uh that has to do with AI is taking a open source Foundation model like Lama which is the open source system which is used everywhere now right every almost every startup uses uses it even large companies so take an open source platform um whether it's an llm or image feature extraction system or a segmentation system whatever and then uh f unun it for a particular vertical application and become an expert in that vertical application and which vertical should we pick like I spoke any vertical right so but I want to know like give me like top three we did Gates we interviewed him recently and he said focus on building that layer around law because the legal processes yeah arrive for disruption that's a good example right if you had to pick one or two more well there's there's I mean in sort of B2B there is there is uh legal accounting business information right I want some report on the competitive situation in a particular segment of the market you know fintech Finance I mean those are obvious obvious areas um uh you know lm's uh information system that give you all the private information inside a company so that any employee can ask any question about anything administrative or whatever uh and and you get the answer you don't have to plow through like multiple internal websites and information system so that that's um that's certainly a good thing um and I think there is a lot of work there in uh basically companies that can find tune models for particular verticles and then there is you know markets that are more consumer um assistance for various things uh you know in in for Education there's not a huge amount of money there unless you can get contracts from the government but education certainly is a we application probably the the the other big one is Health right so there are a lot of companies particularly in the developing world that are being formed for using llm to provide U assistance uh medical assistance essentially you know you C your LM and you say well you know I have those symptoms you know should I go to the hospital or or like you know this is issue I have and it's much easier than to get an appointment with a doctor there certain parts of the world where it's basically impossible to get to see a real doctor um you have to you know travel to a city or something so um so I think that would be useful that you know other applications in rural areas particularly things that are enabled by AI assistant that can speak local languages um and and serve people who are not particularly comfortable with literacy that don't write very much don't read very much so interacting in your language through speech with an a assistant I think opens up a lot of applications um in agriculture and you know all all kinds of are and if I were to switch the lens from an entrepreneur to an investor what would a investor benefit from investing into AI would it be Nvidia llama meta chat GPT open AI okay uh so I think the first order of thing is imagine what the future is going to be five years from now and basically that's going be that's going to be dominated you would do a much better job at Imagining the future than Ian can you pick can you depict a future 5 years from now so 5 years from now the world is going to be dominated by open source platforms um for the same reason that the world of you know embedded devices and operating system is dominated by Linux you know the entire world runs on Linux and it wasn't the case 20 years ago 25 years ago um and it's become so because open source platforms are more portable they're more flexible they're more secure they you know they they they're cheaper to I shouldn't take credit for this but we have somebody called Kash who's our CTO who is a big proponent of this and everything we do is open sourced we have a fund which gives to open source companies and stuff like that right okay so the world is going to be open source we're going to have open source AI platforms uh in a few years they probably be trained in a distributed fashion so they're not going to be kind of completely controlled by single company uh the proprietary engines I think are not going to be nearly as important as they are today because the open source platforms are catching up in terms of performance and then what we know is that a fine-tune open source uh engine like Lama always works better than a non-f tune generic uh you know top performing model so but if everything is open sourced it'll also be democratized for a investor to invest into then what is the differentiation well it enables the ecosystem if you are a startup you're much better off using a bource engine and fine-tuning it for vertical application than you are to you know um using an API because you can build a tailored uh product for for your customers in a in a much much better way so that's the first thing second thing thing is if you really want this technology to be democratized and used by everyone eventually using smart glasses and stuff but but you know at first just smartphones and do you think the form will change soon the form of how you interact with technology will move from smartphones to different kind of devices soon smart glasses yeah I mean yeah there's almost no question you're using one so I don't have them right now although they are in my in my bag right here um I use them all the time yeah I I find them really really uh useful for kind of stuff even if you don't use AI for just taking pictures or listening to music or whatever but but then then you have the AI assistant and I could be you know sitting in a restaurant with a menu in a foreign script and a foreign language and they could be translating it for me right so what happens to intelligence and Society with all of this changing what becomes forget computers and AI for a second for humans what is intelligence in that world so people's intelligence will be moving to different set of tasks than the one we are trying to do today um because a lot of what we're trying to do today will be done by AI systems and so we will focus on other tasks so things like not doing things but deciding what to do or figuring out what to do okay those are two different things like think about the difference between a lowlevel employee in a company MH that is told what to do and just does it and then you you know a high level manager in the company that has to figure out like strategy and think about like what to do and then tell people below what to do okay we're going to we're all going to be a boss we're all going to be like those uh high level managers we're going to tell our AI system what to do but we're not going to have to do it ourselves necessarily okay so but we need lesser people to tell something more efficient than as what to do then we need today for them to actually do the task right so what happens to everyone else well I think everyone is going to be in that situation is going to have access to AI assistance and um and and be able to delegate a lot of tasks uh you know mostly in the virtual world but eventually in the real world we're going to have at some point domestic robots and and uh start driving cars and things like this once we figure out how to get the system to Le how the real world works from video uh but um um so so the the the type of task on which we're going to be able to concentrate ourself are going to be more abstract the same way you know nobody needs to do like super fast mental arithmetics anymore we have calculators or or you know solve integrals of differential equations we we have to learn the basics of how we do this but we have you know we can use computer tools to do this right um so so it's going to lift the abstraction level at which we can place ourselves and basically enable us to be more creative uh be more productive okay and and there are a lot of things that you and I have learned to do that our descendants would not have to learn to do because that would be taken care of by machines like go to school no no we'll still go to school we'll have to educate ourselves we'll have to there's still going to be the the you know the the competition between humans to kind of do something better than the others or something different more creative always right innately we want to compete with yeah yeah so we're not going to run out of jobs economists that I talk to tell me we're not going to run out of jobs because we're not going to run out of problems um but but we're going to find better solutions to problems with the help of AI maybe we can end today Yan trying to Define what is intelligence really I had written down intelligence is a collection of information and the ability to absorb new skills it's a collection of skills and an ability to learn new skills really quickly or in ability to solve problems without learning this is called zero shot in in the AI business you know you're faced with a new problem and you can think about it for a while and you may not you may never have faced similar problem before you can solve it by just you know thinking and and using your mental model of of the situation that's called zero shot you're not learning a new skill you're just solving a problem from scratch so the combination of those three things you know having already number of skills that you know experience with solving problem accomplishing tasks being able to learn new tasks really quickly with a few trials um and then the next step is being able to solve new problems zero shot without having to learn anything new um that's the combination of those three thing things really is intelligence now thank you Yan so much for doing this uh I'm going to try and figure out how I can do like a course under you wherever you're teaching maybe you can recommend me uh to the college to give me a seat so I can attend some lectures but I'd love to you can do better uh the 2021 edition of my deep learning course yeah is fully available on the internet for free it's all on YouTube all the problems all the um the uh homework and everything I feel like I'm going back to old school I feel like being in front of you and learning first person has a innate value of its own so I'll I'll try and do this and and that wonderful thank you so much Yan for doing this thank you pleasure real [Music] pleasure thank you that was fun that was fun yeah you didn't get bored no you ask you ask your professor to speak like you know that's the job but I I guess like when you're talking to people who know so much lesser than you it can't be fun all the time it's it's an art uh I mean I I don't I don't claim to be I don't claim to be particularly good at it but I I try hard so you know trying to kind of simplify Concepts and stuff like that yeah so but I think we needed it because so many Indians are speaking about AI but so few of us actually understand what went behind where we are oh that's true across the world it's not just India in fact I think it's kind of the opposite in India there like way more people who are who are kind of educating themselves like particularly among the young people so we wanted to focus today on that like just to get to telling our people a lot of young people watch this young bright people yeah how we got to be where we are today the most questions around that yeah I think it's important because it it it helps convince people that uh they can do it regardless of what yeah like you know I went to I studed Engineering in France but I didn't go to like one of the top you know equivalent League or anything I went to like in regular school right um um and I didn't do my PhD with a famous person and you know all that stuff and I was in France I was writing papers in French that were terrible nobody read but you know kind of managed to do something and and people are are sometimes are telling me like you're you know you help convince me that I could do something impactful even though I didn't go to Harvard or MIT or stf thank you [Music]"

    "transcript": "[Music] Nikesh Aurora. Oh boy, where do we begin? A boy from Gazyabad who's now one of the highest paid execs in the world. That's Nikesh for you. He's collected degrees like people collect Pokémon, constantly pivoted way before it was cool. Worked at Google after landing an accidental interview with Larry Page, then at Soft Bank, and now leads Paulo Alto Networks, a big name in cyber security. Let's find out how not sticking to a lane worked in his favor. [Music] hi Nikkesh, thank you for doing this. My pleasure. Uh, I don't know where to begin. There's no fixed agenda for today or not. There isn't one particular thing I want out. Mhm. Uh our audience is largely the entrepreneur want to be entrepreneur crowd in India and we meet people who have gone down their path been really successful such as yourself and try to tell them what they can learn from someone like you or what yeah from either doing what I did or not doing what I did. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Sometimes we find not doing what someone did is as useful if not more. For sure. Uh so maybe we can begin by you telling us a bit about yourself and we start from there. How would you like to start childhood? Ah as you know I grew up in India. Uh my father was in the Indian Air Force. So you know you grew up in the Indian Air Force. You grew up with just enough means so you have a good life. But uh you're no different than every other person who grew up in India where you have to be resourceful. you have to be um you have to work hard to get above the crowd and and uh and sort of make something out of your life. And in that context and my parents are amazing. Uh my father passed away a few years ago but uh he worked in the air force for his entire life. He was a lawyer u and his job was to solve thorny legal issues both within and without. And you know when you live in a family like that where every day he's trying to get people to do the right thing uh the sort of the you absorb the implicit culture of the high integrity you see around you. So you know I have my father to thank for a life of integrity where he had to make decisions against all odds. He had to make decisions about lots of things where you know it was crystal clear for him given that the role he has was always to pick the right side that somehow that became the mantra in our family that he always had to do the right thing irrespect of the cost and so that's sort of you get that from your father and my mother uh you know rare for her time she's a masters in math and Sanskrit so she was very along along along the lines of that education empowers and whatever you do you have to be smart, you have to be well read and you have to to do that and know she provides a nurturing element in the family. So I was very blessed. Uh the difference when you work in the air force, you move around every few years. So it brings a sense of impermanence. It brings a sense of uh instability perhaps and the question is what you make out of it. So you know on the flip side you you get to adapt to many situations and you can pick up your bags and move uh because you've done that naturally over your life. So, so those are some of the sort of sort of the I'd say the key building blocks of one's personality as you grow up, right? And how did the transition from growing up in Gazyabad and going to school in Delhi to where you sit today? I must say uh you have a very pretty office but everybody seems really scared of you. Ah, that's interesting. How did you pick that up? Before you arrived, like people were like, \"He's coming now. He's coming now. He's coming now.\" And they really were freaking out. Like I've been to some secure buildings in my life, but you have some crazy amount of security going on here as well. Well, remember you're in the security business, so we're a trophy company to break the security defenses up, right? Because as you can imagine, the security industry comes from an underpinning where it was, you know, your perception of a security person generally is that if you think back a few years ago is that kid sitting in his Paris basement playing Call of Duty on the side hacking into the FBI computers and showing, look, I can do it. There's no economic motivation. There's more of a trophy kill. And that sort of feeling persists in the security industry. If you go after somebody, go after the people who are entrusted with protecting everybody else. So we do have to have more security than you expect. Has it happened? Uh there is a general belief that uh most security companies and now infrastructure software companies are constantly attacked right because uh you know 10 15 years ago the philosophy was you wanted something you went after it and you got it. You know you want to hack into Nikil's life you go hack Nikil you find out what he wants. Then they said well that's a lot of work. Why don't we just go hack into a Gmail platform or email platform and then I can go and get whatever I want from whoever. So people started going towards what we call supply chain attacks. You went after a big piece of infrastructure and whoever was utilizing that piece of infrastructure would then be fair game. So you know we we joke in our industry hacking has gone from a hobby to a profession and you do something professionally to do it right. So yeah it happens a lot. Is that because the incentives have gotten more aligned now? Well, uh, if you think about it, there's something to the tune of north of 10 billion dollars that is either extorted or ransomwareed or taken from individuals in some sort of Ponzi schemes which is based on digital sort of hacking every year. Yeah. So, it's a lot of money. Yeah. But that does sound like a earthshattering problem that amount of money. Well, it's a earth shattering problem because think about it. uh it's still the wild west, right? Because there's no recourse. Think about it's the lowest conviction, right? Uh vertical in the bad actor industry, right? You can hack somebody from 10,000 5,000 mi away, you can get paid in some version of cryptocurrency and you're untraceable. So it's like much better than if you watch, you remember the old westerns you would watch and you had to wear your hat and carry your guns and there's a 50% probability you'll get shot by somebody. In this case, it's pretty low impact. If Palo Alto is a hundred billion dollar company, I would have assumed that this is a much bigger industry as well. It's getting bigger every year. But don't forget there's the there's the economic uh incentive part of it. There is the uh intellectual property part of it. There's the nation state part of it. Right? We think most future wars as you can see uh if the current wars that are in play are part cyber wars and part technology wars, right? people are trying to figure out the lowest cost way to create instability, chaos and destruction of life and property without it costing them too much. And the first thing that happened in the Russia Ukraine conflict was the entire logistic systems of Ukraine were taken down, right, by hackers because that was the way they could de sort of destabilize and immobilize the army of Ukraine. It wasn't a bomb that landed, it was a cyber attack. Mhm. So you can see that sort of the the future norm as it relates to creating instability, taking control, stealing property both intellectual or economic is going to be sort of eased by cyber. I have a private equity fund Nikesh and I have been trying to figure out what industry might thrive in 10 years post all the disruption of today. I'm sure disruptions will continue to come by. But how does cyber security change? And as a investor who's looking to get allocation if I have a broad portfolio, what percentage of that do you think should go into something like cyber security? Like if you analyze cyber security, it didn't exist as an industry subvertical of significance till about 25 years ago. Mhm. If you go back, you know, I was at Banaris doing a um commencement address at BHU and I was reflecting when I went to school there in ' 89, we had one ICL1904. There was nothing called an iPhone. And that computer was 5,000 times less powerful than one iPhone, right? So in you know what was then 30 years you've got 5,000 times the power in the thing we carry in our in our back pocket. Mhm. Um but it's about 2005 I think was when we started getting the app economy and everything started getting connected. So that was not even 20 years ago. 20 years ago we were not worried about getting hacked because most of us were using our phones to call somebody or at best send a sort of old form text. Right? So if you believe the entire connectivity revolution has exploded in the last 20 years and continues to sort of grow exponentially with where we are uh in our province we call that the attack surface continues to expand. Now you can attack 5 billion online people around the world you can attack every company. In the past no company was connected to their consumers. So if you believe the attack surface continues to expand exponentially and every service becomes somewhat useless without connectivity. Now your car has to be connected. If you can't connect to your car, you can't get into your Whimo. And tomorrow, I'm pretty sure robotic arms will be connected and humanoids will be connected. So if the attack surface continues to expand, there is the demand function is secured. Right? Now the question is can you satisfy the demand function with the right technology and that becomes sort of the cyber security industry. So I don't know how it'll compare to other industries, but I'm pretty sure it is a gift that'll keep on giving. Will it come down to who has more compute and by virtue of that they can hack into something if I had more compute than Palo Alto for example? Would it be possible for me to hack into it? So there is that you know prevailing theory that when quantum comes about it'll break every key which is true. It will break every key that is there today. But can you explain how that is? I read that but I couldn't understand cuz I'm a totally non-technical person. So the way it works is when you communicate with something else and you're trying to send data in an encrypted fashion, I send I encrypt it. I send it to you. We decrypt it to your end. So nobody intercept it and steal it or observe it or read it. Right now the industry has a protocol where there is a protocol which defines how to decrypt, how to share keys. So you have the key that is required to decrypt the communication I sent to you. Those keys are effectively co-c codified in such a way that it's hard to break them but and it will require a lot of compute to break them. But with the arrival of quantum they will be able to break those keys in seconds or minutes as compared to days because quantum has more comput power. Right. So if you can do that you need a whole new set of keys. Mhm. Or you need more complicated you need keys that quantum can't break which means you need a new set of protocols to define it. So there is this periling theory that when quantum comes about it'll break today's encryption. So everything will be decryptible and hence observable and hence could lead to potential hacks. Now the sad truth is most hacks today are way less sophisticated than that right typically there are human beings who make errors in configuration. Human beings who click in the wrong email that comes to you human beings who leave their password in a yellow sticky on the side of the computer to make it easy for people to get into. So I think from that perspective we have enough of a crisis right now. We don't need yet another one from a comput perspective. But I think in the flip side the possibility uh of this notion of AI which will start figuring out on the fly where the the gaps misconfigurations or the errors are and be able to be much more intelligent at providing more real-time protection are going to be. So I think the opportunity is going to be more in AI based analytics and real-time protection to start with than just really throwing more computers a problem. So from three lens as an investor as an individual and speaking to the people who are starting small enterprises across the world as an investor if I want exposure to cyber security how should I look at it like what should I look out for in a company? Um if you're looking at a startup category, yeah, the most likely categories which will see outsized returns are categories where a new attack vector is being born and there are many ideas about how to secure the attack vector and many people are experimenting. Take the current example of AI. We all talk about AI and we were just getting our arms around Chad GPT and LLMs and suddenly you have coding assistance and now we're talking about agentic AI all these things that are out there. I don't think there is a general agreement on what agentic AI means in the world. Mhm. Right. And I was talking to somebody this morning and I was saying to me my manifestation of a genetic AI is a whimo in San Francisco. You get an oimo, you let the car decide where to take you. We let the car decide when to break, when to turn. M that's giving agency to the car. Hence it becomes agentic AI right now I don't think most enterprises or human beings are ready to give an AI agent control as simple things like you know can if I told you it's easy to imagine that if you were coming to San Francisco you'll ask your favorite AI bot or LLM or agent to find you a nice restaurant where you like to eat it'll understand your preferences and know who your friends are and say I want to eat with my true friends I want to eat a nice Indian meal find me a restaurant which is more liking my taste to make the reservation Mhm. Now, if you trust AI to do all of that for you and show up blindly over there, that would be called giving agency to that agent to let it decide for you, right? I don't think we're ready as human beings to let even that basic to hand over that basic agency. So, so a long way of saying that if you're building technology, uh, think about those scenarios. Think about a scenario that if Nikl gave agency to an agent and somebody took over that agent, what chaos would they be able to cause, right? And this will happen when AI moves from in many ways for a lot of people including me it's very question and answer right now. Yes. You're talking about when it is able to do more sequential tasks in a way able to do things right and everybody's trying to solve for that right. Yes. So there's two elements right there. The planning element and the doing element right today it does a task. Book me an airline ticket. When do you want to go? It's kind of like writing a piece of code. But it says find the best option. Yeah. Infer what the best option is. Figure out what's most convenient to me. figure out the time I should be flying from here. Figure out that allows me to get there to the right time based on my calendar or whatever you have. You something is planning this that inference engine everybody's trying to build for every use case. Yeah. That inference engine then will we connect let's call it to a do engine and if you can infer and do that becomes your agent. Yeah. Now the good news is that's going to be fun. Exciting news for cyber security is that once that happens I don't have to bother you. I can just take over agent and cause chaos. Right now you can think of simple agents making restaurant reservations which is I'd call it non-destructive as a wor of a bad meal. You can also make it more complicated and say you know it can change the entire configuration of my firewall can change the entire configuration of the heating cooling system of Palo Alto because you have an agent which checks climate understands how to redo the entire heat settings for the company. So there are all kinds of different examples from control systems to industrial systems to robotic systems you can think of which eventually will want agency and they will become an interesting place for bad actors to try and take control because those agents will allow you to act on behalf of whoever's agent you've taken over. So if you had so I say to these companies who are building these solutions they'd be very interesting because it's an unknown problem. It is a field which has not been fully expo explored. There is no resident expert today. There's no resident installed base. So it's a sort of a, you know, blue sky problem. And startup founders are notoriously good at trying to attack those problems, solve them. Either they'll build a big company out of it or they'll get bought out by somebody who wants to solve their problem. Yeah. I'm working with this company here while I'm here and they were demoing their new browser yesterday. Yes. And if you had many tabs open, it could do a few things which seemed very sequential in nature. agentic browser. Yeah. Yes. That's almost here, right? Because that was a live product. They've not launched yet, but it seems to be getting really, really close. Yeah. I think the idea of automated tasks in sequence has been around for a while. People have called it a playbook. People have called it a workflow. Uh I think the question really becomes is when will you let a planning agent control it versus you control it yourself? Interesting. For a meaningful task. Mhm. You know, you can say I can do a three-step task. I can search the web. I can find you, you know, which which websites are selling great shoes. I can make a catalog of them. I can sort them by size. I can marry that with your preferences which I have in memory and sort. Those are all planned tasks. You actually wrote the plan, something executed your plan. If I give you a nebulous problem, saying find the best shoe for me that I should wear tomorrow. There's too many subjective decisions that need to be made in that process, which means your planning or inferencing brain has to start working, right? Uh which is creating certainty from a lot of nebulous data. I think that's the holy grail. And when you can start getting really good inferencing and planning agents, then it starts to mimic human intelligence. Mhm. So as an individual as a individual investor if I were to look at a new vector a lot of people do say that self-driving cars are not really the best example of AI at least generative learning. Yeah. Well, look, AI was traditionally known used to be machine learning, right? Which is the idea that you could algorithm make you write code and go decipher things cuz they're not really predicting what will come in the road or what will happen next, right? They're more like well, they are acting based on information that they're presented with in the instance. And over time you go from predictable actions to unpredictable situations and figuring out inferencing what you do in that scenario. So there's a little bit of inferencing going on but there'll be more inferencing going on and generative is a whole different conversation right. So that's good that's useful as a investor I can look for new vectors new surfaces where cyber security might be a thing and invest in that. Invest in small companies which might want to build a niche specifically in one thing. Yeah. Well, I think if you if you step back and and look at the broader impact of AI Mhm. Um, you know, I think there are a lot of industries will get appended in the next 10 years. If you take the whole notion of product development and you have a trading platform of sorts, right? your a lot of your trading platform in my my understanding and this is where you're the expert and I'll I'll posit something is you're helping us consumers interact with large data behind it. Yeah. You're making it easy. You're creating forms workflow and eventually you're consummating transactions on my behalf. But the entire UI is designed to make me understand to get the right inputs from me so you can actually understand what I'm doing. Right? I could pick a certain ticker. I can choose a certain amount of shares. I can put it in there. I can buy sell. If you have call options, I can you know uh whatever. So like a typical tra trading platform. If you look at the world, 75% of product development in technology is human beings teaching consumers how to interact with back-end engineering databases and transactions. Yeah. Whether it's light tickets, whether it's Yeah. Trading. Yeah. If I have a smart enough capability through a combination of generative AI and workflow automation where I can talk to this without requiring UI, which we can imagine, right? We can imagine if I have an inference engine, it can say, hey, you know, take the position I had yesterday that I bought, sell it, take half the profits and reinvest them between $100, $110 in, you know, Reliance or whatever your favorite stock is, if Robin Hood, whatever you have, right? you I can imagine how that query or that natural language that that you can literally you're literally in your brain you're planning the steps that are required in your product to go execute that transaction right but it doesn't happen today Mhm. in the future. It's effectively a planning engine planning the tasks calling the four task saying sell yesterday's position take the proceeds understand how many shares I can buy take half then buy those many shares between $110 go back to the users and say I have about $100 100 shares of for you of this and the remaining cash is in your balance we can actually write the steps in our head of that transaction the question is do I have to code all of that and take every scenario and do it or in the future there's an agentic AI or an AI interface that allows it to do and there's an inference engine Mhm. Which means your entire process of product development at zero is going to change. Yeah. Take that and multiply that across every user experience that is out there. Take a different example. Today a lot of applications are designed generically for everyone. Mhm. Right. It's kind of like very little user preference or knowledge. It's just kind of marginal, right? Like you a little bit of understand what you know. But if you can have full memory of my preferences and you're designing an application, whether it's a nutrition app, right, you go to a nutrition app today, it tells you have to pick a whole bunch of stuff by the time you're done filling forms. Five pages later, it tells you eat less carbs. Thank you very much. Right? Or gives you some advice. Over time, I think applications will become applications for one. Yeah. Instead of generic applications. So I think there's a lot of implications of AI in the technology world from a product development perspective, AI in the enterprise software world where I think analytic products will die. Mhm. It'll all be products that help you do something. There's a huge debate. I mean uh you know look at the world of advertising. The whole notion of digital advertising which is about a $450 billion industry is to encourage you and me to buy something or transact. Mhm. People buy ads on the internet so that eventually you and I will either go trade or you and I will go buy something. Mhm. But if our agents start interacting on our behalf and they start assessing what the right answers are, what is the role of advertising in the future? So there's so many implications across the entire technology landscape. I don't think your investor brain should be worried about uh one particular cyber security vector to invest in. Right. The interface in businesses like us. I agree with you 100% will become irrelevant. If I could use the analogy of say cryptocurrency and the blockchain. I think where people like us come in is we're essentially not a company of interface but a company with a regulatory mode. You're you're what I call a system of record. Yeah. You have track of how many shares I own. You're a system of record. If you were to vanish tomorrow, I wouldn't know what my net worth is if I was a Z customer. So yeah. So your system of record and system of records will stay but the entire product development process of how I interface with a system of record will change. system of record will stay when there is regulation behind it which mandates them to stay or will the same apply to a technology like blockchain where there might not be a regulator mandating the system it doesn't have to be regulated right a system of record is almost like I would say something that is built over time right either it's mandated by regulation mandated by enterprises I have a I have you I'm pretty sure you and I have both have payroll systems which are systems of record they're not mandated by regulation but you have a payroll system if it goes away tomorrow you want to know how much you paid someone and how much you have to pay them. The whole mode of interaction of me with your payroll system may be fundamentally different and your head of HR and that might be different but the system of record will stay because it's required as part of your business process to exist. Now system of record could also be there purely because of the fact that I have great market share hence I have the record of that data somewhere and it's too painful for you to replace that system of record even though it's not mandated by regulation. it just happens to be that is where it is. So there is there is a prevailing theory that the big will become bigger because they are if they are smart enough and fast enough ag and agile enough to be able to change the mode of interaction with the system of record and I think that's going to make a lot of enterprise software rethink how it's built how it's run and how it's managed. So if AI becomes democratic, democratic in the means that everybody evolves to a point where everybody's like each other, how big does the role of a brand play in something like this? Why do I pick A over P? Is it just utilitarian or is there a brand play involved? Well, I thought you were asking a societal question which is much harder question. I'll stick with the brand question. I'll stick with the I'll stick with the brand question for you. Now I think look brands are correlated experiences, right? and trust and and perception, right? You know, why do you spend a lot more money for a Cartier bracelet for your wife or your girlfriend than you would for something made by your local jeweler? If you the raw material is the same, the colleges are pretty much the same, but you pay more for the perception, for the brand, for the experience, the trust, the loyalty. So, I think the brand encompasses a lot more than the raw material from that pers. I don't know how democratization of AI changes that. Let's let's take a look at it from a slightly different angle. Mhm. You know the way I say this is partly a societal comment, right? When things like Google came about. If you go historically, historically information was power, right? Cast systems based on power which is basically fundamentally based on information. The highest cast was owned the information and dictated how society should behave. Mhm. And you look, you know, historically a lot of power has been because of an information disadvantage or asymmetry. Mhm. The internet came about, information asymmetry began to vanish, right? The guy who had the newspaper in New Delhi was no longer smarter than the guy in Baronasi next to me who took out the newspaper a day late. Remember places in India got newspaper day late. But today with the internet is instant access. So democratizing information allows it you know a whole series of applications and and experiences to be built. The question is does AI democratize intelligence depending on the definition of intelligence? Well, if you listen to what Sam Alman is telling you and all these wonderful people building AI models, they're talking about AGI or you know artificial general intelligence where these models are going to be able to mimic the human brain or be smarter because they have infinite memory, infinite pattern recognition, our brains are restricted by our capacity but this thing is not. So let's assume for a second without taking the draconian outcome, let's just assume that it normalizes intelligence. And what I mean by normalizing intelligence is if I call zero, I'm sure you have a customer service team, right? There are let's say there are five different people. They have different capabilities, different understanding. I could get a marginally different answer from one of those five people if I called depending on their intelligence if everything was not codified by your system. I'm guessing it's not always because there's a human involved. Now, we're saying AI is going to get so good that it will make that experience consistent on a constant basis. So, it is just normalized intelligence across five people in your team or maybe 5,000 people in your team. So when intelligence gets gets normalized, what are the consequences of that? Then nobody's smarter than the other person. Then what is the differentiation? The differentiation is solving the unknown problem. How do we articulate what the unknown problem is? I would assume that humans from the beginning of time have wanted to differentiate through many different means. Capitalism Nobel prizes. We give Nobel prizes to people who solve unknown problems. I'm sure there's a lot more unknown problems in the world that we haven't touched or scratched the surface of which have to be solved. There's a combination of, you know, now the question is does human intelligence learn how to manage all this democratized intelligence or is AGI going to manage this democratized intelligence? You and I are just going to be drinking in the pub or hanging out at the bar and saying, \"Geez, everything is being done by AGI and AI.\" So, I don't know the answer to that question. But I think the bigger question is like we saw the democratization of information. This is going to democratize intelligence and when intelligence gets democratized what are the business implications societal implications that nobody's smart in the other right like you know how to put a rocket in the air I do too let me talk to my pet agent it knows the answer does capital become the mode then incumbent people with capital I did say the big get bigger right as long as they play their cards right uh because because they have more compute power in that world no I think it's not just capital You know there is a debate today that uh all the known information that is in the public domain has already been used to train AI. Frankly, if you hear the debates, all these models are being trained by all the information out there. I think there's 10 times more information in private domains which is not available in the public domain. All the drug discovery data which is sitting in every drug companies that has made any drug in the past. It's all proprietary data, right? all the intellectual property all the data used to build Nvidia chips or Intel chips all proprietary AMD all this all proprietary maybe quantum computing changes that and everything comes online because everything I don't think quantum computing change I think the question becomes at what point in time do these private databases start being made available and training AI for specific tasks could I design the best chip designing model of course I could if I had all the data that Intel has and Nvidia has there's no human being who has it in their head but possibly some version of AI can understand patterns and build that knowledge base. But once it builds that knowledge base, can it use an inference engine to solve the unknown problem? Right. Right. Today we relied on human intelligence to understand everything the art of the possible and humans have to ideulate and say, well, how do I solve the unknown? Because now you understand the known. But it's a high bar, right? You have to go to I don't know how many years of PhD studies do you have to go to, how many research papers you have to write to get to a point to say, I think I have a good understanding of this sliver of the problem I'm trying to solve. Right? But tomorrow you say guess what that's in your in your edge model sitting in your pocket. It's already as smart as all the intelligence in the world that is being used to solve this particular domain. Now work from there. Mhm. So I think that's the bigger debate or the bigger uh opportunity or the scary part is what happens when this thing gets smart and we start democratizing democratizing intelligence. I mean I I gave you the example of going to Vonasi and saying that was a 5,000th time less powerful computer. In 30 years, we were able to build a 5,000 times powerful computer, right? Imagine if the state of AI, which is which possibly or potentially moves exponentially faster. If AI is a thousand times smarter in 5 years, let alone 5,000 times. What is the art of the possible? I love how you're explaining. Would you like to prophesize how the world might look in 10 years? Just major a guess. No, I I don't know if uh prophesizing is to any value, right? I think you have to take an optimistic outlook towards it. You can prophesize a draconian set of outcomes. You can prophesize an out, you know, optimistic set of outcomes. We all were, you know, you know, we've all lived through this in recent past where we had a pandemic. And if you looked at pre prophesizing the pandemic, you said the pandemic is going to persist for 5 years. I'm pretty sure there would be as many doomsday prophecies as there were uh possibly more than optimistic prophecies. But look around you. They're very extremely resilient as society. I think we forget historical lessons and people will say, \"Oh my god, what's going to happen? AI is going to take my job. What's it going to do?\" Well, guess what? You know, I don't see anybody buying picks and shovels and digging up the ground to plant wheat, right? Things have happened and we've all found something else to do. So, I'm sure we'll find things to do. We'll find find ways to uh propel society further, right? Um and and I'm sure things that get solved easily Mhm. will create new opportunities as I was talking to one of our private equity common friends and he seemed to think that the models, the language models will become like the device, like the iPhone today. Mhm. and the real marketplace is going to be what gets built on top. Do you suspect that to be true? Yeah, I have my own version of that interpretation. I think it's broadly consistent and the way I say it is that what you're getting in the forms of a model or AI is the equivalence of a brain. Mhm. Right. The early version of the brain had pariting capability. It could read everything in the world and repeat it to you. Over time, it bel pattern recognition. Over time, it's building some judgment as based on pattern recognition. What is good, what is bad, what is right, what is wrong. Over time, as you feed it more, it's starting to get PhDs and starting to pass the bar and it's starting to get smart enough to, you know, so it knows the entire world's information. your problem set is known, your answer set is known, is able to answer the questions, able to get smarter and smarter. Now, given the breakneck speed that you you're seeing the evolution of models, they're getting smarter and smarter and there's sort of an arms race, no pun intended, between all these people. And yes, so will people build smarter and smarter and bigger and bigger brains? Yes. But if in your company at Zero Da or at Palo Alto Networks, we said, \"Hey, here's a really smart person.\" Mhm. They have the best brain in the world. Mhm. Eventually, you have to adapt that brain to the problem you're solving. Mhm. Right. That's the art of building something on top. That's the art of creating a wrapper around that brain and applying it to something. Could I take the smartest brain? I could. I have to teach it everything about drugs and say the problem you're trying to solve is solve cancer. Solve the problem. But it requires treating that brain, training that brain, putting guardrails around the brain, making sure the same brain that can solve cancer can also cause cancer, right? If it's smart enough. So you got to figure out apply it to good. So I think the act of wrapping these models or brains with useful things that we wanted to do will be where the art will be and which is what I think our mutual friend is talking about building applications around them. Perhaps as a investor better use of my dollar to be building a wrapper on a brain or trying to secure the brain. Well, clearly the trying to secure the brain, you're asking my question, the cyber security, I just trying to I still staying in the philosophical part of it. Okay. Uh look, I think everybody who's solving a problem necessary or necessary, right? I mean the application world some people are solving necessary problems some people unnecessary problems I really need more social you know media and social applications possibly not but somebody's trying to solve it I think everybody is going to see how they can apply this brain toward solving their specific problem and as an investor a lot bigger share shifts will happen in what is I'll say a stabler ecosystem for now a lot of people will lose share a lot of people gain share depending how they use the brain to solve the problem which is what happened in the last technological inflection right why does Amazon exist they they used the the technology inflection of the internet and connectivity to solve the problem known problem differently and caused a share shift between traditional retail and today right why did Google exist because it shifted outline you know traditional advertising online advertising has used the inflection point of the internet and mobility etc to cause that to happen so the question is or the point is people will use this technology inflection of democratization of intelligence to create to solve the same problem differently. And the ones who solve it differently, faster, much more efficiently, lower friction, lower cost, better economic value, and better outcome are going to have a disproportionate share shift in their direction from legacy players. Now, you know, if I if I had a dollar for every time I heard a legacy player saying, \"I'm smart this time. I'll figure it out.\" Then none of the new economy industry should exist and startups shouldn't exist. So, by definition, people will build better solutions, better mousetraps. And the idea the opportunity for investor has never been larger in that context than just focusing on securing the model which it which look which will not be non-lucrative. Mhm. But it's almost securing the model is harder to discern which person is going to secure the model better. It's easier possibly as an investor to say take a human experience and say I get it. That experience can be fundamentally transformed by applying smarter more intelligence to it. And securing a model might not be so interesting if so many models get to the point where they're almost the same. Leave that to us. We'll take it. Another legacy incumbent saying, \"Oh, we've got this problem solved.\" Very interesting. So that was from a investor's lens. Me as a young person starting a company, how do I look at cyber security? How do I what what are the three things I have to do broadly? you starting a company or just you want to start a cyber security company? No, no, broadly starting a company. I'll come to starting a cyber security company in the end. Look what's fascinating is um for the first time in my life from a technology perspective, I'm seeking out young 23 or 25 year old founders to learn from them. Normally, I'm the sage old man with white hair and people come to me and say, \"Hey, can we talk about starting a company and how do you scale it? How do you make it bigger? How do you live a life like yours at Google soft bank auto? Right now I'm re I reached out to the founder of you know Windsurf or I reached out to the founder of you know uh console.ai or factory and I'm sitting down and picking their brain this morning. I I was talking to a founder of an autonomous car company saying tell me how this new world works. How do you see it? How does this AI going to impact it? How are you building a company which is so funly different than mine? because I'm sitting there saying I might be legacy because techn is moving so fast and it's being done so differently and I read about these companies which hit 100 million in ARR not that it's you know it's it's an achievement but it's it's much faster than anybody else is doing it I see people who say oh I was watching an exchange on on X between two people saying oh thank you we built this feature in 72 hours and shipped it couldn't have been done between the two of our companies if you guys hadn't put your heart and soul to it and oh by the way thanks to our coding agent so I'm sitting the pace of innovation has fundamentally inflected and I feel like I just don't want to be sitting here you gazing at my own navl saying oh my god you know we've got this covered so it hasn't been more uncertain than today right so all I can advise people who are out there is uh you know teach us something because they've got it figured out but more so I think the the wave of technology that is coming is going to allow Oh, people to build businesses faster with more agility, a lower number of people, and fundamentally rethink them. And if you're not doing that, if your rethink is marginal, if you're looking for a 10 20% improvement, don't bother because things are about to move 10x. So, I think self-reflect on the idea. If your idea is not 10x worthy, you're solving the wrong problem. I feel the exact same way. I've met a bunch of really bright kids every day for lunch and dinner the last week and I just feel stupid. Like I'm like that's why I'm here for longer than I was meant to and I want to come back because I feel like suddenly this area has become some kind of a hub. It's fascinating, you know, two or three years ago and it happens every four or five years, right? And I moved here in 2009 and I I just moved because I was, you know, going to be part of Google's team. Uh uh and I moved here at that point in time, the buzz was social, right? You know, it was Snapchat and Facebook and and YouTube was going from strength to strength and Instagram was getting bought and, you know, WhatsApp was getting bought. That was kind of the time in in you know 2009 10ish time frame and then people say oh my god this this wave is coming to an end what's going to happen and suddenly so the crypto wave arrived like suddenly everything was crypto around you and there was crypto crypto crypto blockchain you know whole bunch of coins and whole bunch of stuff the spa wave and again people called the end of San Francisco and said oh my god it's a city you can't go to and suddenly it's the AI wave AI companies out there buying up real estate in San Francisco building businesses and if you Ask the world where is the hub of AI? It seems to be here. Every AI model that is being built with a reason except perhaps in China is headquartered here. Do you think India should try and build a model? We are trying. Um we should I think the question becomes is a capex question you know um we can talk I mean you're much smarter about the Indian ecosystem than I will ever be. India has not shown a propensity for large capex projects with unclear returns perhaps is the best way to say it. Yeah. Right. Uh you can't walk around and raise $50 billion. Mhm. uh and build two nuclear plants to fund AGI today irrespective of who you are and irrespective of who your investors are from the Indian subcontinent. Yeah. And you know so that that's where I think that the constraint there is the appetite for people to deploy large amounts of capital. I agree with you. But on the flip side in a world which is getting increasingly fragmented on the geopolitical lens and tariffs and all of that the question is also if somebody turns off a tap that we have built so much upon what happens then explain that like let's say we've used a model based out of China as the base to a lot of stuff that we have worked on and one day they shut it down and India doesn't have its own what happens then there will always be the next version of the model. Mhm. So even if you were using one and they transition to the new one, then you have the less smarter model because the next one's smarter, faster, better, cheaper, right? So that that risk is constantly there. It's not just access to the current model that you have. Mhm. Um, one would hope that with the arms race we talked about, there's north of 10,000 models in hugging face, many of them open sourced. So at least there is data there's art out the prior art out there which allows you to experiment and play with it but I think but even when they open source the model they don't open source the weights they have used they there are some models you can modify weights so look I understand the value of having a frontier model of your own where you can control your own destiny it comes at a high cost today the question is yes should I mean the unequivocal answer is yes we should in India the question is who has the financial capacity and desire to go deploy tens of billions ions of dollars to go fund that and where is the talent to go do that. If both those conditions are met, yes, we should and then you'll talk about power where is the you know where is the gigawatt needed to go fund that training of the model. The other option is you find models that are out there. Again, not attempting to prophesize because we agreed we weren't going to do that. But there is hope that the current pace of development that is going on in the model world. Everybody wants access to various talent pools who can leverage those models because that creates market share. Mhm. So I'm hopeful that if you know geopolitical conditions don't get so bad that nobody's talking to each other which I hopefully will not arrive there will always be the possibility of collaborating with a model somewhere in the world which will be willing to work in a part of the world which has 1.8 billion people give or take you know which is 24 23 20% of the world's population. You'd want that model to be experimenting in that kind of environment with so many smart people with such a large middle class with so much progress ahead of it that it would be silly to ignore that market the needs of that market from a model provider perspective and data of 10 one and a half billion people is equally appetizing. That's right. Very interesting. Coming back to the cyber security question, uh you told me as a investor what niche I can look at the verticals. You told me as a entrepreneur if I want to start a company what are the things I should watch out for or what kind of cyber security company I should try and build. The last thing I wanted to ask you on AI is somebody described it to me in this manner that they said world output is about hundred trillion. Let's assume 50 50% of that is in services. Even if AI is able to disrupt 10% of that, $5 trillion will justify all the money spent on Infra and Capeex that has gone into the world of AI right now, right? If you were to have a dollar to invest into every AI company today, do you think it's over inflated? Do you think you'll make money in a decade at today's valuation? That's a hard call right now. Normalizing for execution. Some people will execute better than the others, right? Some people will be able to sustain better than the others. And as you know better than I do, in the world of businesses which are not making money, you your survival is only guaranteed till the next fund raise. Yeah. Right. So if I had a dollar to give and you said, \"Well, you make money in 10 years.\" The question is can you sustain the fundraising through that period until you turn cash flow positive otherwise you've seen companies which have gone away because they were not able to raise their next round or the round was so dilutive that nobody wanted to deal with it or so you know all those conditions notwithstanding I think it's a bigger question from an economic value proposition you're asking you know is there enough there there here in the entire industry that it justifies what is being spent today without regard for which company you invest in let's take the company dynamics out private facia It it seems to be the prevailing wisdom, right? The fact that people are raising money, you know, the companies have raised money at $2 billion, 6 months ago, raising money at $4 billion right now is unprecedented. You never heard that degree of development and conviction that is happening in the market today. So clearly there is a gold rush. Now we've seen past gold rushes. So I give you the answer in two parts. You know, it's kind of like the, you know, overestimating the short-term, underestimating the long-term answer, which is I think the long-term trend points towards something like you hypothesized that there is enough opportunity to eliminate redundancy, run work, you know, repetitive tasks and solving the same problem multiple times, which was never leverable. Right? And now you hire a consulting firm to do a project in company A. How many B CDE E through you know Z are going to pay the same amount of money to do the same project because there's no democratization of intelligence. Intelligence is captive and it's being sold one at a time. When it's democratized every guest at the same time which means it lowers the cost to deliver it. So in that if you apply that logic the logic suggests that yes we can shave off a lot of lot of inefficiency a lot of increase economic value tremendously which should justify this desire to invest in democratizing intelligence which should justify the fact that once this democratized intelligence made available generally to all of us we will find a way of creating more economic value because we'll get faster you know higher quality lower friction and more competence/ better output. short term it goes back to the execution questions as to which is the right one of these. Yeah. Does it make sense? Is there enough uh economic value in the category that you're putting billions of dollars to work that it justifies the category? So I think all those questions uh it could be Robin Hood moment. It could be people taking from the rich and giving to the poor. I was having this conversation with someone last week on how we can get India to be a lot more innovative and we were trying to figure out why on the scale of innovation uh new ideas per se not enough have been rooted from there in the past. We had this debate around a whole bunch of things you know budget for research in academia stuff like that but it seems to come down to one thing that the risk capital available there like you just said a kid out of Stanford could get 20 million to go and build an idea actually better still a kid dropped out of Stanford they have a higher chance yeah I met like two dozen of them last night and the I was telling them the seniors who are just like finishing college I'm like there has been no better time for anyone to have graduated from Stanford than you guys cuz whatever you come up with you'll get that's been true every 5 years by the way but okay it's just you're telling us we're getting old right right yeah but what do you think it is what should India change is it risk capital like this debate comes up everywhere right you know for the last 25 years I've been asked you know why is there one Silicon Valley and why are there not many Silicon valleys in the world and you know you want to make Silicon Valley of India and Bangalore for Israel is a Silicon Valley of uh sorry you know uh yeah is a Silicon Valley for cyber security etc. I think it boils down to a combination of things and I think it's it's hard to get the combination of things together in one place. Mhm. Uh partly it's sort of things like you've identified risk capital is part uh talent and resources. It's part uh infrastructure is part availability. All of that is part ease of doing business and all those things sort of fit in the mixer and you shake it and you know a lot of that gets in there. I think it's it's also partly the acceptance of failure. Yeah. Right. Culturally, I grew up there and you grew up there and maybe it's getting better now. Failure is not as easily accepted anywhere in the world but in Silicon Valley. Yeah, there are founders here who've had companies fail and started second company and third companies. There founders who've, you know, done something wrong, come back and started companies and the market gives them the benefit of doubt and funds them again and again and says, \"Yes, I understand you have tremendous appetite for risk. You dream big.\" So, it's partly that in terms of I think a lot of it is cultural. I agree with you 100%. I have a speech trainer who's Israeli. His name is Michael and he keeps telling me in the Israeli society, people celebrate failure especially in the startups and the tech companies of there. I don't know how to get people to incorporate that. How do they change? I have bought 20 companies in the last seven years apart and for the most part they've been startups and I'd say more than 50% of them have been from Israel. But even there there's a different risk trade-off post success. I can meet founders here, look them in the eye, a founder will tell me, well, we're building a $100 million company without blinking. It's like a kid who dropped out two years ago. He's going to build $100 million company. Israel, they feel very lucky if they build a billion dollar company. They're happy to sell it and say, \"I'm out. This is this is an outcome I never expected.\" So, it's it's there's a lot of cultural stuff in there. There's a lot of cultural acceptance of failure, cultural sort of role modeling uh is kind of maybe in the water here. People think if I go to Silicon Valley, drink the water, it's going to be a better outcome than to drink the water in New Delhi or Gura, right? So I think there's a lot of lot of a whole host of factors but I think capital is definitely in today's world especially where we are capital is definitely a constraint and also don't forget u there's pattern recognition right? Yeah. name the last five 20 billion companies that came out of the Indian ecosystem. Yeah. Then live to tell the story. Mhm. So there's also that like you know every time you turn around it's going to happen. It doesn't happen. People say oh my god maybe there is more than ice that is visible to me that holds me back from doing it. Fair point. So you went to IIT and then MS from Boston and MBA from Northeastern. The other way around but same difference. That's a lot of studying. Not really. It's a lot easier to study in the US than it is in India. So you could study and work here at the same time. So it was study and work at the same time. No, the the I came here to go to business school at Northeastern. Uh I wasn't smart enough to get into the IM in India. They're too competitive. But you were at IIT. I was at possibly more competitive. Well that point in time a lot less than it is today. But I think they have more of them right now than them. We were I was there about six of them and we were called it. We're not even I not even a full-fledged IT at that point in time. Uh yeah, I did that. Couldn't get into business school in India. I even didn't even try that hard. I think I left in the middle of the CAT exam. I went to watch a movie with my girlfriend at that point in time. So maybe it was me. Um came to the US. Uh they said I have to teach computer science. I hadn't studied computer science. It was a slight problem. So I spent the summer brushing up on whatever I could learn. I taught computer science at Nor Eastern. I went to business school there. Um cuz 92 when I graduated it was a recession. It was hard to get a job. I I wrote 400 plus letters to people applying for a job and you know like sometimes the printer ran out of ink but I knew it was a rejection letter but pretty much it said in the first sentence but they forgot the signature part. So I had like 400 I still have them. I had 400 rejection letters of my life lying in my house. And one theme that was kind of persistent through all of them when I applied because you know you know I got like those earbooks. Yeah. My MBA yearbook said most likely end up at Wall Street. My Wall Street rejection said not enough finance. There's a bit of a cognitive disconnect between my peers and and the street and uh so that's why I got a masters in finance from BC. I felt like I had to compensate for lack of finance and I ended up getting a CFA as well at that point in time. Yeah. But that's what caused the the backto-back two degrees and I was lucky enough to in those days I think systems weren't as robust. I had seven rejection letters from Fidelity before I got a job for the eighth person. So, thank God they weren't comparing notes. Does education hold the same value today? In today's world, would you spend as many years doing what you did? You know, the older we get, the more we value education and experience. Mhm. The younger we are, the more irreverent we are of experience and education. So I I think I I agree with staying the stereotype I should value education and experience but I think the 23-y old kid who I met who's building a $100 billion company will tell you that I'm full of and all my experiences or not and he's got more risk appetite than I do outside of experiences would you go back and do the education if it took you 8 years 10 years how muchever time it did take you know for somebody who had never worked in the western culture who had never spent much time interacting with people here. I always say education is as much a social experience as there's a learning experience. The network that you build. No, not in the network. I mean like I have young kids, right? And I run into people in Silicon Valley especially where the debate is, oh, I'm homeschooling my kids because school is not smart enough to teach my kids. And you run into this all the time. People say I got to homeschool my kids. Now, of course, I don't know how you get through life as a parent. You have to arrange every sport game, every like literally you are now the orchestrator of your child's schedule. But let's put that aside. They have this perception that my kid doesn't learn enough. But then the question I ask is when you go to school there are 10 kids in the class or 20 kids in the class. You learn social interaction. You learn competition. You learn not getting what you ask for on a constant basis. You learn not getting attention from people. You learn different personalities, how to interact with them, that's a social experiment. Yeah. Now, if you're going to be so smart that you don't need people around you, yes, God bless you. And maybe that's a good thing for you to do. But I think 99.9% of us need people. So to some degree the collective learning experience is important and uh it sets you up on how to live life around people, how to live life around different personalities. Now if you spend too much of your time over there you become an academic and all you do is learn how to prophesize and and write papers and so would I go back and do as much? Maybe, maybe not. But at that point in time that was the benchmark. If it were a social experiment, I would probably learn more or be better off with more diversity, right? So rather than going to an affluent college where everybody is the similar, you know, they have either an IQ or some kind of other thing that has brought them there, would I be not better off just going to a park and playing with different kind of kids for 8 hours a day? Uh, sure. But if you had to make peace with the same people and see them every day for two years, you'd be much nicer and much more different and much more managed. If you showed up at the park and say, \"I don't like these kids. I'm not coming tomorrow.\" And you play with different set because you have no skin in the game, right? Like, you know, and families in the game. We love our families and we hate parts of our families, but we're stuck with them. So, people drop out of free colleges more than they drop out of paid colleges in a way. Didn't know that, but that's really true. Right. So you transitioned to tech after Fidelity. That's a completely different career. Not quite. You know, we can say I was tech or is tech. When I've been to business school, I was teaching some version of tech. Uh at Fidelity. Actually, I worked in their technology department in finance. The first five years I was there. So I was still analyzing tech the wrong tech. When I went to Putnham, I was analyzing tech and telecom as a byside analyst. So I was always paying attention to the business of tech perhaps is a better way to describe it. I was never spending time coding or writing code. Uh if I did maybe I'd have founded a company myself and got smarter but no I was always involved in the business of tech. Right. That's actually uh a novelty which is a new thing almost in society where not founders of company but executives I think you're like the poster child of that who have become extremely wealthy and billionaires and all of that. Do you see a sorry I'm trying to find where the slur is in that but go on. So these two parts of of either founding a company or being an executive like yourself, I think there's a smaller crowd like you which have done exceptionally well. How do you think those journeys are different and what kind of personality type is suited for which? That's an interesting question. Look, we live in Silicon Valley. So you know there was a big debate as you may remember maybe 12 14 18 months ago. Brian Chesky sparked that off. founder mode where somehow founders were more uh had a higher moral right to go run build great businesses long-term and bigger ones than possibly executives. And I think look at the end of the day eventually a company company is a combination of a product and a business around it. Mhm. A product only company is not a company. Eventually somebody has to show up with the economics for that product to have been worthy of being invested in. We just had this conversation about AI $5 trillion of services will be saved. Hence it makes sense to invest all this. Now the question becomes you know horses for courses. What is the right time for a product impassioned individual to go ahead and build the best product in the world as long as they can get the right capital attracted to go build the product. At what point in time does that product need to be wrapped with the right application or business model where it becomes a business that actually generates value for the buyer or the other side? Now I think the answer is slightly different in let's call them consumer businesses and enterprise businesses. In the consumer business, you can build a great product, you can create value, and you can find some basic fundamental economic mechanism like charge a subscription or sell advertising against it. Those are a little easier. Advertising is harder than subscription. If you're running Netflix, at the end, you pay 19 bucks, you don't pay 90 bucks, I'm going to keep working the product, event, you'll pay me 19 bucks, right? And I have to worry about each one of you because there's so many of you. If some of it's okay. There are many consumer businesses where you're fundamentally a product company with distribution and marketing. Right? And then over time your mode becomes distribution and your product sometimes doesn't stay as good but you still own distribution. Right? There are examples of that in the world. But eventually if you don't build a good product though even those companies begin to peter off. So let's leave it there. In that case it perhaps makes even more sense for a founder to persist where there's this constant need to product innovate because that drives the entire distribution and consumption of the product. In the case of enterprise you see a different variation. And if you look at this example used of executives, I saw a recent article somewhere which talks about executives, I'd say 75% of those executives named there are actually enterprise CEOs. Mhm. Not consumer CEOs, funnily enough. And the reason is because enterprise is a combination of great product building a business ecosystem around it and making sure that you build an effective motion around delivering that innovation to various businesses which is a combination of not just like I met a founder the other day of an enterprise company. He's like I love building the product. I hate going to c customers and trying to explain to them why this is a great product. I lose patience because they don't understand why this is a great product and then eventually I have to take them to dinner to get them to buy. Mhm. And the founder doesn't like that. He wants to build a great product. Business executives say there's power for the course. You know, I got to do all of these things in about so I am as products and petrified as they come. I'm constantly, you know, challenging myself especially my biggest, you know, as I said to you, my one of my current fears is what happens to AI? Does it all does it make all of us obsolete in the way we run our businesses and way we build our products and the product we build. So there's an existential crisis with AI around all those three dimensions for most companies in tech right now. So then the question becomes you know and this you goes past founder or executives to the notion of what kind of team does it take to win like I tell my team you're the best at what you do but I reserve the right to jump in and help you do what you do. My job is not to do what you do. I can't do everything my CFO does. I can't do everything my chief product officer does. I can't do everything that my chief marketer says. Am I you know have I seen it been around long enough? Have I seen it? Have I done it enough? Yes, I have. So, I can jump in and work with them on certain things. Course correct, point to the right northstar involve going there. Yes. So, then I just need to make sure that I'm paired I've paired myself with a phenomenal set of technical people who are as product savvy as they come. And sometimes you'll find great technical people, but they they don't dream as big as founders. They're not bad technical people. They're equally smart. They just don't have a risk appetite. I can bring the risk appetite. So I think part of winning and I'm sure you see that in your business part of winning is surrounding yourself with the right team. Not just the best at what they do, right? But the right intermix of the people and personalities you need. And I think that's been one of the things that I've been particularly excited about having done in my life. Whether it was a team I built at Google and the people I worked at the soft bank or people I built up all the networks. I think we found the formula where we can find the right set of people who complement each other and bring the right balance of conservatism, risk appetite, execution and ideas and competence that allows us to at least try and aim for above average outcome. So in a way you're saying the the mark of a great leader in enterprise is hiring the best lieutenants. I think you're oversimplifying it but I won't take the bait. uh I think the mark of any winning leader is mobilizing a set of very good people around them to create great outcomes right and it doesn't have to be just the hiring part hiring is not enough you got to make sure that they perform and hiring is just the beginning of the journey and you have to make sure you're constantly course correcting and adapting and making that happen and you have to keep your eye on the northstar it kind of tends to move sometimes the most vivid memory or recollection I have is when you joined Soft Bank, you were all over the news in India for your salary and stuff like and in Japan as well, believe me. And Japan as well. How was that? How was that experience? How was Masa? How was working with him? How was it to be as popular as you were for your salary of all things? That's that's it's part for the course, but it's not what you aspire for. It's kind of that's a way of keeping score. People keep score that way, right? That's the way it's like you know, do you still keep score that way? No, it's the way people keep score. Uh and again, it's a tough question to answer. Yeah. What? There's no good answer to that question, right? If you say I keep score that way, then it makes you sound you're materialistic. If you say I don't care, makes you sound like you don't care. If you were to ask me, I would have said yes. That question, that's how people keep score. Sc score score. Again, I think being well compensated is a good outcome. Yeah. uh you know it sometimes becomes more or less it's a different issue. We live in a capitalistic world and we all have voted for capitalism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Although we you know we constantly fighting the battle between democracy and capitalism which sometimes end up at odds but that's a different context. Can't a democracy can't a democracy have capitalism? I think we have democratically voted for capitalism. Not quite. I I was with this uh very interesting business person uh who tried to you know run for public office and did not succeed and I asked her I said what is the biggest you asked the question about the biggest glaring memory or fact what was the biggest difference in how you lived your entire life till you were 50 and then you tried for 5 years how was the biggest difference she's like she's like you know I classify my first 50 years of my life as an attempt to pursue capitalistic outcomes in the next 5 years democratic outcomes. And she said the biggest difference in capitalism is $1, one vote. Democracies is one person, one vote. Do you think it's $1, one vote today? In capitalism, yeah, your shareholders decide. My largest shoulder can dictate what I should do if my 100% shareholder can fully tell me what to do. In democracy, there's no one shareholder, right? There's no five shareholders. There's no five board members who have an higher weighted voice because they represent majority of the capital. So what system do you think America of today? Let's go back to the other conversation. I'm not a I'm not a political commentator. So it's kind of like hey unless I probably put my foot in my mouth unnecessarily. So after Google and after you joined Soft Bank, how was it working with MASA? Just tell me like people that you've worked with like Larry Paige Masa if there is one thing you've learned from each of them. You know it's kind of it fits the way I think about people because very often you get cliche questions like who's your role model? Yeah. Or you know like I say well do you believe in the concept of role model? Uh I believe in the concept of admiring people for something that they're really good at and not admiring thing for other things they're not good at. Yeah. But like you know we're our most interesting person in the world right now is puzzly you know outside that the the what is that guy the this Mexican guy who's the most interesting man in the world the most never mind there is there is you can go back and Google it but today the most interesting person in the world possibly Elon Musk right everybody knows about him or he wants to know about him now you can admire him for a lot of things but you know do I want to have 15 children with five different people or do I want to be you know in politics so there are a lot of things that you can admire about him there are things you may want to be. So I think modeling your entire life around one person is a big ask. Yeah. I think admiring people for what they do. And I turned 40. I made a conscious choice. I said from now on when I meet people I'm going to think about what they're really good at because you know getting to 40 I went back and thought you know what we have a tendency of looking through a filter and saying well this person's not great because they're not great at X or they don't do X or Y well. And they realize that you actually have a mental frame of what made you succeed and hence people were more like your personality or did things like you were more respectable or liked by you and then people who did it differently were not as interesting because perhaps they didn't have the right answer because they hadn't done it. But you can flip that lens and say you know what some people have succeeded in certain things in a way I would have never have imagined. There's something interesting. How do they do that? And you look around you know you're blessed and I'm blessed. We always run into people who achieve something in life or about to your 12 founders I'm sure going to be great in 10 years from now or it's the only people you and I mutually know are probably great at what they do. So in that context you can look at people and say what do I admire about these people and you mentioned people I'd work with. I remember a conversation Larry recited to me when he just come back after meeting Steve Jobs. I never met him but Larry did. And Steve had called Larry and said, \"You know what? In that time, Google was a small company and Apple was still a big company.\" And Steve told Larry, \"Larry, look at the model. The model is we do one thing, we do it really well.\" Mhm. If you do one thing really well and win around the world, you're going to win. And here was Larry, you know, busy doing Gmail, Chrome, Google search, maps, local, a whole bunch of stuff. And Larry had a different point of view. He said, \"Look, I don't believe that. I believe it's a it's a question of capacity. If you have great people, you can motivate them. They can go build great stuff.\" Mhm. As long as you focus on building a great product. Doesn't matter if you do one or many. So Larry was product obsessed. In fact, you know, much to my annoyance perhaps at that point in time, but I see the wisdom of his ways, when he became CEO of Google, he said, \"I'm going to have 10 direct reports. There's going to be one CFO.\" Mhm. One lawyer and one business person and seven product people. He said, \"Nik, you can do all the business stuff.\" Mhm. And I was so proud. I went to my first one-on-one with Larry and said, \"Hey, Larry, you know, we should chat.\" and I had this beautiful presentation ready to walk him through how he managed the 30,000 people. And he looked at me, he says, \"Bill Campbell tells me you're decent or good at what you do. Uh, I have to go build great products in the company so you keep doing what you're doing. I'm sure if I had a few hours, I could help you do your job 20% better.\" I said, \"Larry, let me know when you have two hours.\" And I left. And he never found the two hours for me because he was busy fixing product. He was product obsessed. But you learned from him that and he ceased to say that you know like tech companies which lose sight of great products eventually fail. Mhm. So and you look around you that is true in technology you know a company like Sun Microsystem Yahoo all these companies are great tech companies at their at their heydays and eventually they lost sight of product and eventually they didn't they didn't succeed and take masa you know I say as we grow up we spend our life perhaps more so in India we talked about cultural things right we spend our life derisking our children explain the kid is porn. You want to drop for school, say, \"Hold my hand.\" Every time you cross the road, you look left, you look right. Don't eat that. Don't touch that. That's dirty. Right. Don't put that in your mouth. How many times have your parents or my parents admonished us as a mechan of showing their love and trying to teach us the way of life in constantly allowing sort of taking from their mental model what was risky, what could have some consequence, and trying not to have their kids do that, right? and she was out of life. And of course, our favorite Indian pastor was like, \"It's time you got old. It's time for you to get married and settle down, right? Because we're deemed unsettled.\" Yeah. And possibly prone to high risk if you're not married. Yeah. So there's whole whole sort of cultural philosophy is to settle your kids. Make them they make sure they have a stable job, stable life, kids, and they're fully settled. That's the best risk manager in the world. It's your mother. Mhm. Right. And here we're sitting and talking about taking more risk, dreaming bigger and building great things. So with that as a frame of reference, Masa was the was the kid, you know, he turned 50 when I I started working with him and I'd say between the age of 50 to 60, he was sort of Benjamin Button, right? He was going touching everything his mother said don't touch and he was eating putting everything in his mouth and being more and more risky and big dreaming bigger than anyone else I've known in my life. Forget any entrepreneur. Every entrepreneur was trying to take risk to build a stable business and get rich. Ma the other way around. What are we going to do today? Great. All in. What are we doing tomorrow? I'm all in. Masa has a phenomenal risk appetite. And if you look at it, that's the way he led his life. And funnily enough, you know, he struck it four times. You know, he built Soft Bank from nothing. He built Yahoo Japan. He built he he invested in Alibaba. He did ARM. All these things have worked for him. And by the way, you know, he had risk appetite because his volatility is high. He was the richest man in the world for a few days and then he was almost bankrupt at one point in time. So you learn that you know risk appetite is actually something we govern but it is significantly uh influenced culturally. It seems like a good way to live. If we have one life and life is meant to be experienced masa's way. Yes. I think that's that's true and you and I have the luxury to be able to say that. Uh it doesn't work well with Maslo's hierarchy. M you have well mass hierarchy suggest that you know what it is and like you know when you find a person who has no food and no money and has to feed his family he's not worried about taking more risk and living more life he's looking to create that stability so the risk appetite can change when you reach the aspiration state of your life the point is he recognized do you think AI changes that more people move higher up the order in the hierarchy you're moving questions too fast I wasn't done with the last one thinking through that But uh do I think AI changes our risk appetite? I don't think anything changes Maslo's hierarchy. Mhm. In fact, I think there is a risk in the short term that AI creates more fear around Maslo's hierarchy than not because look if you read everything out there if you see the science it seems like you know repetitive tasks are going to get easily overtaken by AI and that's kind of be its contribution to society in the next two to three years which directly targeted targets the early and career part of people's lives and the part where they're trying to go pay their college loans in this country or where they're trying to settle down and you know get get sort of their basic needs met. So the question is if I can't get out of college with a with a with a loan and find a job that I'm going to be adding value on then that probably impacts my my mass loss hierarchy more than it impacts my risk appetite. But if there is no social mobility really in the world and rich people stay rich people and they stay higher up in Masslo's hierarchy, do you think generationally people become more risk averse or they're able to take risk more easily like your kids or the kids of your kids would be freer in taking risk? You know, it's kind of very interesting social experiment here. Mhm. Um I can I think you can talk about predisposition but not personality. What I mean by that is because your kids or my kids are going to grow up in a slightly different circumstance that perhaps you and I grew up with. They're going to have different predispositions. Mhm. Like you know you know when I grew up my father didn't have a car till I was 18. Right. You know we ate meat once a week because that was the norm. Same. Right. So that's a different culture upbringing than my kids. My kids don't have those constraints. They don't live with scarcity. So but the question is it's very hard and this is you should ask a sociologist this question as opposed to me. But it's very hard to take that and ascertain where the drive comes from. I have seen very wellto-do kids who have tremendous drive who want to prove something. I've seen very poor kids with no drive. So there seems to be a difference of you know gene in you which defines how you drive yourself and how you think about ambition and proving yourself. Uh you know I'm sure the the the upbringing the factors around you have a role in finally defining what your passion is and where you go prove yourself. But I still feel that there's an inner drive that comes from something different for people which is somewhat uh not 100% correlated to upbringing. Like I have siblings, you have siblings. We're very different. We're very different people. Parents, our parents the same. We grew up in the same house. We grew up with the same value system, you know, with very different outcomes and very different motivations, very different ways of living our life. Well, I don't know why that is. So nature versus nurture very remember nurture is the same. Mhm. You can argue majority of DNA is the same. Maybe you know one gene is more dominant than the other in certain cases. So it's minor modifications, right? Any fleeting thought Nikesh? I must say this is one of my favorite podcast. You must not have done many. Then I've loved this conversation. But any fleeting thought that you want to like leave behind? I'll let you ask the questions. That's too generic a comment. We can talk about anything you want. Okay. Since you've given me that privilege, I give you $100. Mhm. And I let you either go long or go short one sector for the next decade long one first. Look, by definition, technology is lifelong long, right? If you look historically 35% of the S&P is made of technology companies 30 years ago it was none right so by definition what has happened is technology has taken over majority of sectors in life and there's a possibility it'll continue to take majority of sectors of life um I'm sure this is going to come bite me in the future but on the short side services has to be a short right by definition the whole idea of services is that we deploy humans towards repetitive tasks where we sell intelligence or process with people. If if the impending opportunity in front of us is that process is going to be simplified or overtaken by AI and intelligence is going to be democratized then there has to be a reshaping of the services economy. Makes sense. But thank you so much for taking the time and doing this pleasure and uh hope to see you again soon. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. You'll make sure every time you made me do that, you'll just look it over. Right. All right. Thanks. Nice to see you, man. Was that fun? That was fun. Yeah. [Music]"

    "transcript": "Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] You seem like a very certain person. You take the contrarian opinion in a very certain manner. Almost certainly with no doubt, there isn't a job where AI won't be able to do 80% of 80% of all jobs. And that's what today's 20 or 22 year old has to take for granted. [Music] Hi Vinod, thank you for doing this. For our audience in India which are largely entrepreneurs or going to be entrepreneurs, I don't want to introduce you. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about your life. Your story is very well known so I don't have to rehash it for them. But maybe you tell us a bit about life, how you began and where you are today. Well, you know, life my life has been pretty simple. Well, I haven't done too many things, too many different things, but I was always curious about technology. And the piece people don't understand is or don't know. I would say there's nothing to understand. Do you want me to stop when there's a sound overhead or keep going? Is it okay? Yeah, it's okay. Okay. uh makes it more natural. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes people do and sometimes people don't. Right. Do you do a lot of these interviews? I do a fair number. Yeah. Yeah. Um when I was 16, I'd go from Delhi where I lived. Mhm. To Old Delhi to rent old magazines. That's how you got access to information. There was no place to go Mhm. to get access to magazines or others unless you could afford to buy them and we couldn't. So, uh, but I used to get old issues of technology magazines, uh, especially the electronic engineering times to see what was going on. And I read about Andy Grove as a Hungarian immigrant coming and starting a company here. And that's what fascinated me and got me interested in why can't I start a technology company? I had very little interest and still have very little interest in business. I do it because it needs to be done but I mostly am interested in technology and the impact it can have. So I got enamored by this guy and all I knew about Hungary was they had great stamps. So if you collected stamps back then you always wanted Hungarian stamps. Mhm. But I followed his story. Why did you want Hungarian stamps? Oh, I used to collect stamps as a kid. There wasn't like 16 things to do. There was no internet. There was no libraries you had access to. There was not a lot of magazines. You there wasn't much to read or get information from. So, you had hobbies like stamp collecting or coin collecting or uh I I couldn't afford vintage car collecting which some people did but I worked on cars like that but um so there wasn't a whole lot to do. Um and I used to read these magazines while renting them and usually when the magazine got old in the area like in the US they got shipped and you could rent them. So that's what uh fascinated me. It could be done. I didn't know anybody in business. I didn't have anybody I knew who was actually in business. So I didn't know what that was like. Mhm. Neither family nor otherwise. So you did engineering at IIT and then came to the US for your masters at Carnegie Melon in biomedical engineering and then business in Stanford. Which part of this academic career formed you or shaped you today? You know, I would say every step was about a particular goal. Mhm. engineering at it was because I was interested in technology and electrical engineering seemed pretty damn interesting. There was nothing called computer science back then. That was I joined IIT in 1971. Um so that was interesting and then I got curious about biomed engineering. U there wasn't really such a discipline. We did some projects in India in biomedical engineering but there was no biomedical engineering department anywhere in India and I got involved with a professor there professor Guha and we did some things between IIT Delhi and all India institute of medical sciences I was curious and then I just said well masters in uh biomedical engineering would be cool and so I came to the US to do my masters but my real goal goal was to get to Silicon Valley and start a company, right? And the MBA was a necessity just to get to Silicon Valley, right? So, I have an agenda for today, Ben Venod. Mhm. As an investor, the big question I have today is since everything is changing so quickly with technology changing, I want to figure out which industries, sectors might be most relevant 10 years from now. either to invest in or build a business in. The question is essentially as a young entrepreneur in India where do the tailwinds really lie and where should I focus my efforts on over the next decade. So, a lot of what I'm going to talk to you about today will kind of like focus on that. And uh from all that I've watched in your interviews and from the few times I've spoken to you via that common uh pledge community we are part of, you seem like a very certain person. uh certainty has been an element of most interviews I've watched say 10 years ago, 5 years ago or even today. You take the contrarian opinion in a very certain manner. To me, I feel like certainty is not necessarily a good thing, but it's the innate human conditioning. Uh, do you see yourself like that? As somebody who believes in something and makes up his mind and sticks to it? Um, I would say no. I would say well, you know this when you built your company. Mhm. Think about how much did you know about where you would end up? Nothing. Nothing. Mhm. That's true most of the time. Mhm. Did you even know the space you were in was a valuable space to start a company in? You probably did have some hunch of that. So I I I like to say my fundamental belief in life is people have personalities and they choose to either reinforce that or go beyond that. And there's two ways. One is you don't want to fail, which fundamentally means you don't want to take risks, which fundamentally means you're not going to do anything new. And that's perfectly reasonable thing to do. And people get comfort in that certainty. That certainty is of very little value to me. What I like is a shot at doing the impossible. And I like to say skeptics never did the impossible. Think about it. If you're a skeptic, you're always finding reasons why something won't work. If you're starting your company and if you paid attention to all the things you didn't know or didn't know you didn't know, you wouldn't start the company and where would you be? You'd have a steady job in some corporation and this fine. It's a perfectly respectable thing to do, but you wouldn't be creating anything new. Would you say a skeptic and a contrarian investor have a lot in common? A contrarian is skeptical about the incumbent norms of the day. Um I would say no. Skeptics to me are always saying why things can't be done. Mhm. Entrepreneurs um in investors is a whole different thing. I don't really think of myself as an investor or always saying what if something was possible. Mhm. And in the technology world, it's particularly important cuz I'm never certain, but I know what technology makes possible quite well. I can make reasonable guesses at what the world could be and then you work to make that world happen. If you happen to make it happen, it'll be successful whether you're a entrepreneur or an investor. And I always think about my life that way. Like if something's possible, I want to make it happen. Mhm. You know, electric cars were always possible. You knew you could put a battery in a motor in a car instead of a gasoline engine or a diesel engine. Uh but nobody in the automotive business was going to do it. And if they did, they made halfarted poor attempts. You know, General Motors spent billions of dollars trying to do a half-ass job at an electric vehicle, EV1, EV2. Toyota did the lowrisk approach of adding a hybrid engine. Uh you don't create the different world that way. You increment it. And there is a world of incremental innovation and lots to do there. But people who want to be in the safe domain do that. Elon Musk created an electric vehicle almost went bankrupt a few times in doing it but he followed his belief there and then made the world happen. I don't believe if we'd have electric cars dominant today be 25% of our car all car sales in California today. um if Elon hadn't made that world happen. So every expert in every large automotive company or every McKenzie study would say the opposite of what actually happened. And it's sort of this if it's possible, you have to make it happen. It doesn't matter whether you're talking about cars or rockets or the internet. You know, the telco companies, AT&T and all those people had such naive ideas about what the internet should be. Um they told me in 1996 when we started Juniper, they would never adapt this PIP. Mhm. And I do believe if Pradep Synindu and I hadn't started Juniper, there would be no TCP IP in the public internet. Mhm. Cuz Cisco was not going to develop anything. And any of the traditional telco suppliers did the simple thing of listening to their customers, which is a good habit if you're trying to be incremental, a really bad thing if you're trying to be revolutionary. For everybody who doesn't know you veno, if I were to describe you in like 60 seconds, I would say a very precautious, academically gifted Indian boy who went to IIT Delhi, came into the US, picked two other friends and started Sun Micros Systemystems and then picked a great bet after the liquidity event of selling Sun or part of it in picking TCP IP over the ATM protocol of of the time. And then ever since then, you're more the kind of investor who's betting on edge cases, who's probably taking a 100 bets knowing 95 will fail, but the five will give you exponential returns. Is that a good way to describe you? I don't think so. Uh that's not how I think of myself. I think no matter what you en environment you're in. Mhm. Now what's key is I got sparked by reading a single article about Andy Grove starting Intel in Silicon Valley. Mhm. And that must have been 1970 or somewhere around then. Mhm. That was 1516 something like that. um and then sort of not stopping there right saying how do I make this happen I'll give you examples when I was at when I started at IIT Delhi there wasn't a single computer programming class at any IIT anywhere right in India mh so what did I do I said that'd be cool to do so we started a computer programming ing club and start the first real class in programming at any as a hobby club. Mhm. In IIT Delhi. There was four of us and we just we sort of made that happen. Mhm. I was talking about biomedical engineering. What happened? I got curious about as an electrical engineer, the electrical phenomena in the human body. um the heart, the brain, the the the nervous system. And so we started literally started with three or four of us the biomedical engineering program at IIT Delhi, right? It wasn't an official sanctioned thing. and and and you say to people at 16 or 17 you can make programs new programs happen at IIT Delhi as a student or new programming happen it's not what people imagine possible but but I just sort of had this tendency to not accept the things as they were so I think if if I were to characterize myself if I thought something should happen. Uh whether it's starting a company in Silicon Valley or starting a biomedical engineering program or the first ever computer programming uh class in any IIT, you just sort of worked at making that happen and be clever about how to make it happen. Not say, you know, the usual thing people would say is they should start a computer programming class. Well, they is who's they? either you do it or you don't and make it happen. And it's no different. That was a microcosm of what Elan Mini said. They should be electric electric vehicles and I'll create them because they, which is General Motors and Ford and Volkswagen, aren't going to make that. So, it's this characteristic of imagining what's possible, especially technologically, and then just making them happen. Sun was the same way. My first startup before Sun, Daisy Systems was the same way. Um, and there were, you know, so you take on imagine the possible and try and make it happen and don't give up when it fails even in a single journey. And you know, five things could have failed at any one of these efforts definitely at some or others. Mhm. but never gave up. I wanted to come to Silicon Valley. Stanford rejected me twice, said no to admitting me. And I I always found a way to come at keep at it. So, persistence, sort of passion for a vision and then persistence through being kicked in in the shins many many times. Um you you don't give up on that. To what end? Venod because it's your passion. Right. Right. And I think the most important thing in life is a passion for a vision to make it happen and then the persistence to make it happen as you go through the ups and downs and and frankly um also being smart about how you approach it, what teams you assemble just do you think that's the point of life today? Uh well, everybody should have a different point in life, right? If I'm a great artist, my point in life may be just great painting, right? And if I'm a great artist, my point may be great paintings I love, or it could be great paintings that go for great prices at the New York art auction. I I believe those are not the genuine artists. The artist who paints for themselves is the gen artist. It's whatever mission you set for your life, right? And I think most happiness and most troubles and travails come from pursuing a mission. That's a great way to describe it. If you can tell me today at 70 ven what is your passion? What are you looking forward to in life? Oh, I'm I expect in the next 20 years at age 70 if I'm healthy because that's one thing nobody controls. uh I expect I will do more affect more change in the world in the next 15 20 years. Mhm. than I've done in the last 50 years of my life. That's very simply the goal and it'll be to make certain things happen that I'm passionate about. And why is that the goal? To affect change in the world. Is it posterity? No. Uh and you know I believe when you die you die and I'll be buried under some tree and my ash is wrinkled somewhere or logic logically that would mean that you have to improve the qualitative nature of life today versus worry about the change you create. Well, so I think the question to ask and the question I say is let's say say 25 years from now age age 95. My father lived to age 95. So that's a good metric. If I'm lying on my deathbed, what do I wish I'd spent the last 25 years on? Almost certainly it won't be I wish I made more money. M almost certainly it wouldn't be I wish I played more golf or went sailing or spent more time at resorts. None of that I think will matter to me. Yeah. So So or I owned another house. Do you suspect it would be the change you brought in the world? I think it'll be how satisfied my brain is with what it was able to do and I how I utilize my brain. I think a lot of people when asked the same question on their deathbed, they tend to see they tend to say things like, \"I wish I spent more time with my friends. I wish I loved more. I wish I was more myself and didn't have to put on a mask or a projection.\" And uh so that's really important. So by far I still always prioritize family over work. I know your family. I Yep. You met them? Yes. At the giving pledge. Um the nobody would say I don't spend enough time there and I love spending time with my dogs. In fact, so I do prioritize that thing, but I can't impose my time on my kids. So how much time I spend is more constrained by them, not by me. and I'm very close to all my kids. Um, so yes, it's what matters to you. Family definitely is right at the top, but going drinking with buddies, that's just I don't like drinking anymore. Uh, maybe. Did you ever? No, I never did. But, you know, I didn't mind going out for a beer. I don't do that anymore. Uh what I really enjoy is whatever time I can spend with family and helping the people I care about in any way. But that's more constrained by their time, not by my time. Mhm. And then it's use my brain to solve hard problems that nobody else will work on. So it's additionality in that sense. if I can work on things. Look, I'm almost certain fusion, Commonwealth Fusion wouldn't have started and the world needs fusion. Mhm. And it's Yes, that's a good thing to do, but it's also like selfish for me because it's a hard problem and the hardness is what I love solving for. Why is that, Venon? Why do you like a harder problem? Why do people like climbing Mount Everest instead of a smaller mountain? Ego. So few can do it. So I did it. It's a big deal. Well, so you could call it that. Yeah. I like things that will have a large impact. So in that sense, it's legacy. But do but I do it in a way where I'm not the entrepreneur building Commonwealth Fusion. Sam Alman's building open AI, right? Uh, you know, there's ar no building public transit, but the world needs all these things. So, you know, I have a document I wrote up that's a public document when I was 60. Mhm. So, that was the that AI will change the world. No, no, the the at 60 I said what do I want to do by then? back then I said next 25 years of my life. Uh I at 70 I still say next 25 years. I feel like uh I'm in the same time horizon. Mhm. But I wrote a document. It's a 50-page document on what do I want to work on for the rest of my life. Mhm. And I called it reinventing societal infrastructure with technology. Mostly because everybody I talked to said it can't be done. And so it was really the Mount Everest aspect of a hard problem that doesn't think that people don't think can be done that I imagine 10 years ago and it's a public document. It's on our website. So, and I just thought when I started on the writing that I thought I'd find one problem to work on. Mhm. And I found there was no part of private GDP, non-governmental GDP. Mhm. That I couldn't work on in a way that would be hugely multiplicative. Mhm. That means give all 8 billion people on the planet the same lifestyle that the richest 800 million people on the planet, 10% have without destroying the planet. And I've always been passionate on the climate issue, right? Because it's such a long-term problem, people don't spend enough time on it. It's not something that can be solved when it shows up, right? Um so um I defined them and started working on them and our portfolio 10 years later reflects all those areas pretty much. Now we do other things too because we have to have decent fund returns to keep getting the privilege of investing more. Um but that's those heart problems really challenged me and you know my old partner John Der used to say the only the way to get something done is told tell no that can't be done and I I I do that that's an ego thing if something can't be done then I want to attempt it right in your many successful pursuits as an entrepreneur has the techn technology element of it or the ability to sell an idea element of it. What has been more valuable to you? I think I always first focus on what technology makes possible. Mhm. So one of my goals in my lifetime is to eliminate most cars in most cities. Mhm. So if we put a 25 year metric on that by 2050 we should be able to eliminate that. Now there isn't another person in the world who told me that's reasonable. I'm pretty sure it not only can be done but it will be done. Will it be directly proportional to the density of population in cities? No, I think most transit should be public transit. So in a tier three four five town with a scarce population of say I'm making a case for urbanization turning around deurbanization almost say instead of millions of people crowding around one city center you have smaller cities fewer people far spread out does public transportation work from that lens yes for the following reason and this is what I mean by these are conceived as hard engineering pro hard problems but if you're clever you can solve them um in fact you're exactly right that's the model for India so in the year 2000 I wrote a blog they weren't called blogs then um called the bicycle commute economy for India and essentially I speculated instead of having everybody from the villages migrate to the major cities and having huge huge cities like we are starting to have. There should be a city like aggregation of people. So you get economies of scale within a bicycle commute of the hometown or the home village of every person. Mhm. all billion and a half people in India but it was less than a billion and a half back then and I figured there'd be 3,000 major cities there's 700 districts in India um so the idea that there was sort of an aggregation Mhm. of a a million or two million people in each side as the optimal size of a city where it's still small and personal and within a bicycle commute but people aren't moving from Bihar to Mumbai. Mhm. Uh and not able to go see their family very often which leads to social isolation, broken up families, drinking all that other stuff. Do you think AI is bad for big cities and good for smaller cities? The model you're explaining, I I think AI is good either way. Mhm. Uh and we can come back to it. I I watched your interview of the utopian and dystopian scenarios where you made a very utopian case for it. Yes. Uh I did. But you know, it was around 2000 that I wrote this piece called the bicycle commute economy. It might even be on our website still. Mhm. And it was specifically for how the India was discussing how to set up the telecommunications network. Mhm. Where to set up you know they they were mostly thinking landlines then not cell phones and um but my point is that is a good aggregation and but policy will determine that. Mhm. Not technology. Mhm. And then technology will serve that scenario. I did believe with the right telecommunications infrastructure and good communications, you could enable that model to work without needing to move to a big city because a lot could be done locally and today believed that technology even more so today can make that possible and make a lot of the services that weren't available in a small city of a million or two million people possible today. Mhm. So really have every person in India be able to live within a bicycle commute. Now today's a little different but back then most of the population was rural. So you had to speculate that most of it will move to cities as happened in this country and happened in other countries too. Right. Right. China's seen some of this migration with pretty negative consequences of people moving away from their communities. If you were a betting man, would you bet on deurbanization or urbanization in the next decade? Uh, I think it will depend on in each country on the policies they adapt and the incentive systems they set up. Which do you suspect is a better policy? Oh, dearization is clearly a better policy. Right. Yeah, I believe. Right. And if I would bring it back to our audience, Venod, assume I'm a 22year-old boy or girl in India. I want to learn from Venod who has done a spectacular job of calling what industries might do well tomorrow in I want help from you in figuring out where I should spend the next 10 or 20 years of my life. Which industry should I work in in terms of a job or which industry should I start a company in? So now you come to a very hard question. Um you know if I'm 20 by the time I'm 35 the year 2040 the world will be more different from today by in 15 years. Mhm. Well within the lifetime. If you go into medical school and take five six years doing that, you waste your half that time than the world is today from 20 1970. So you'd have to look back 50 years 50 years or more. Why don't you call 5 years for me? I want to learn from you in making my career choice today. So if 10 15 years are too far ahead to extrapolate I'm 22 today tell me for when I'm 27 5 years from now. So the the answer is the same for both right sorry long-winded way right the point I was making is we'll see more change in next 15 years than we've seen the last 50. Mhm. And 50 years ago the the world especially in India was a very very different world. Mhm. You know in 1970 I never had a TV at home or a telephone at home. Like even when I left India I'd never had a telephone or a TV at home. Right. Right. It wasn't something that was in most homes in India or running water or very basic things. And that's how different the world will be in 15 years. Um almost certainly with no doubt there isn't a job where AI won't be able to do 80% of 80% of all jobs. So 80% of all jobs AI will be able to do most of it within the next three to five years. So now I'm getting really in. So if you look 10 or 15 years out, there's no chance there's a job that humans do that AI can't do almost as well with some minor exceptions which I think today I have a hard time saying will happen for sure for regulatory or other reasons like a heart surgeon or a brain surgeon. But even those AI will be able to do it better than a human, but regulation may not allow it, right? But leaving aside those exceptions, the vast majority of jobs um will be done will be capable of being done by an AI. Mhm. And that's what today's 20 or 22 year old has to take for granted. So what matters the first the single most important thing that matters is not specialization in a area. I don't learn welding or I don't learn finance. Uh I learn the ability to learn. Mhm. Be able to move around rapidly as the world evolves and learn rapidly. And I have to say today at age 70 I'm learning at a much faster pace than I've ever learned in my whole life ever. Uh in every 20 year old should strive for this ability to jump into any new area. Mhm. Uh whether it's a physics problem or a biology problem or a finance problem. just this ability to think from first principles and learning new areas because GPT can teach you any new areas uh and AI will have that capability to be able to leverage these things well. So I would say you have to optimize your career for flexibility not a single profession. Okay, that's the most important advice because you don't know what will be around. Uh, almost certainly this interview could be done without us physically meeting on real video generated by an AI and the AI may be directed with what camera angle somebody wants. Mhm. I hear you Vinod when you say the rate of change will be faster. I'm going to as a 22 year old be more adaptable and flexible. I still need to make a choice today. Do I work in a IT services company? Do I work in a nuclear fusion company? Do I work in a data center? I still need to pick. Yeah. So I I I do think it almost doesn't matter where you start, right? Okay. I'm saying first education is going to be valuable to have learn to learn how to learn not to be good at one thing like being an accountant or a chartered accountant right that's not going to be important but that education the process of learning how to learn and in fact one of the best things about computer science isn't that you can look you know programming. Mhm. Because you know Google's gone from 0% AI generated code to I think they last claimed 35% of all code being written in Google is being written by an AI. But it's the process of thinking that computer science teaches you really well. Mhm. and learning architectures and systems and system thing. Some of those things uh are about learning to learn but you can do it in a number of areas. So it's not just computer science. Um, so I would say there's a wide range of things, but keeping your lens zoomed out for the widest angle is sort of the way to think about how you should go about your career. So you're saying don't be a specialist, be a generalist. Be a generalist, not a specialist. Absolutely. Right. And learn how to be a generalist. Mhm. Learn how to use AI at the best. Uh and we may be, you know, maybe it'll eliminate all jobs. AI will. But the fact is for certain the people who don't know how to use AI will be obsoleted by people who know how to use AI first, right? And there if you're dynamic and learning, then you can move with whatever is happening in the world. I would say the following. It's just because we can't predict the future doesn't mean it won't be dramatically different. Mhm. We just don't know what it will be. I like to say something else um which is most people most of the time assume improbables are not important. Mhm. I've always assumed the exact opposite. Only the impro improbables are important. We just don't know which of a thousand improbables is important. So what do you do in that case? You go for agility. You follow trends. You move around. You be more adaptable and flexible. Do more for more first principles thinking. It's a very different way of growing up whether you're 20 or you're 60 or 70. And you know clearly I'm learning more now as I said and so today I feel like uh I can have an intelligent conversation around cell therapy in biology or about fusion. I can do both. Or about caro efficiency in steam engines which we discussed today for some asteric reason. You know um certain fundamental things uh you you have a broad knowledge on which you can build other knowledge. So what is that pedestal of knowledge you acquire and how do you keep expanding it is very very important. Most people stop learning and I think I would say you know if you get a job as a waiter at a restaurant 20 years later you haven't gained a lot more expertise that you didn't gain in the first year as a waiter at a restaurant you're not exponential compounding of your capability but other jobs if I pick the right one your knowledge compounds and your capab capability compounds over time. So I would look at the basic principle of financial compounding in in knowledge and cap job capability as a young individual what will make it compound and then you have to intersect that with what's interesting to me what do I have passion for if AI were to disrupt all jobs will AI also need to be nationalized and we move back to a socialistic economy in a I you know look or does capital continue to remain the mode going into a world like that? It's very hard to tell. It depends on policies each country adapts and I think each country or at least each region will make different choices. Um so why do we have capitalism? It was fundamentally for economic efficiency. The world of Adam Smith was about economic efficiency. And the idea that if if a human is doing a job, they'll be much more efficient if they're doing it for themselves and earning more income. the the the need for efficiency may decline dramatically in most areas, not in all areas. You you know, you'll still need to be efficient in the amount of steel or cement or copper you use, but efficiencies role will decline. Mhm. enhance uh how you structure it and how you give the benefits of these technologies to everybody is is a social choice. It's not a technology choice. It's not a choice entrepreneurs will make. Could one argue that before Adam Smith cropped up in Scotland, if you go back many centuries before that, man was still looking out for his best, his own interest. So we might not have had the term capitalism in today's parl. Always about capitalism, right? In a post AI world as well, we will feel the need to distinguish ourselves and compete. Yes. But will we have the ability to? So imagine the following. uh you've seen my wife's company CK12. If every child in India, which I hope happens in the next five years, has a free AI tutor. That's entirely possible today at a small fraction of the education government budget the government has today. And it'll be better than the best education a a rich person can offer their kids by hiring them personal teachers. Almost certainly the AI will do a better job than the most expensive tutor or teacher you can hire for your kids if you're rich and can afford anything. In that world, education is really free and it's ongoing. Mhm. And whether it's sixth grade education or college education or professional education, it doesn't matter. And you'll be able to do anything at any time and switch your majors because you don't have to go back to college for three or five years uh to change from electrical engineering to mechanical engineering or from medicine to something else. Uh I think that world is soon. Um imagine so education's free. Imagine if medical expertise was free. Mhm. Every doctor was free. Mhm. Imagine every lawyer was free and every judge was free. So AI could judge a a legal dispute. So everybody had access Mhm. you know most people in India probably can't hire a lawyer to enforce their rights and that's why we don't have real justice, right? Access to fairness. uh and of course the courts are b bottlenecked and you can have AI judges. So and frankly 10 years ago I wrote about the poorest person can have the best wealth advisor. Mhm. at their level, even if they're making 5,000 rupees a month, they because they can because it's in and somebody who makes a lot more won't have better advisor. In fact, even if you want to just tax jar, dodge and other do tax schemes and stuff, the AI will be able to figure that out better than a human. So in that world, how do you distribute wealth? If if a farm worker can do the same job that an oncologist can, you pay them the same, almost certainly it'll be true 15 years from now. And I mean that almost certainly it'll be true. Right? So very hard to predict how this sorts out and many countries will resist it because unemployment it causes dislocation. Mhm. Which people always object to. Mhm. Based on that if the AI models of today the incumbent world are controlled by one geography how do you think of sovereign AI in countries like India? Well, that's why we have um we have Saram in India. You know, I've always assumed countries will want sovereign AI. That's why we invest in Saram in India. We invest in a company called Sakana in Japan for the same reason. Now, certain populations aren't large enough to have their own AI, but regions do. Do you think the time is near when we all start capitalizing and protecting our data in a manner that we give access to some AI based on our preferences or geographies? Uh again that'll be a function of government policy. Right. But Europeans have very different data policy than the US does. Right. likely outcome. You think? I don't think so. I think look, you can choose not to share any information with Google today. Mhm. Or wipe out all your information. But do you then get the benefits of the services on which they can c which they can customize to you? I have no question I'd rather share my data and get customized services than get services that are not customized to me. I would say that if my data is the commodity that is bringing revenue to company X, I would want to get a share in the revenue in one manner or another. But you do um Reed Hoffman has a new book called Super Agency. If you read it, he talks about the fact that you know if you ask people the following question at what price would you not use Facebook, right? Like if how much would you pay if I said I'm taking it away, but you can get it back if you pay for it. And it's like $40 or $50 a month. Mhm. How much does Faith's book make from you per month on average? About4 or $50 a year. So you're getting pick a number $600 worth of value and they're getting $50 worth of value in a year. What is a fair exchange? Everybody has the option to not buy into these services. Now, there's lots of nuances, but is an economic surplus created? Yes. Um, again, it's a policy question. Yeah. it kind of like government policy will have a lot more to do with these things than people realize today and you know I've argued and I would argue as part of Aadhaar today we have UPI which takes away the need for Visa and Mastercard so it's a 3% tax on the economy that Indians don't pay but everybody in the US pays uh Uh but what if in in addition to your payment services there was medical services and education services. My bet is every Indian could get that at less than a dollar a month or a billion dollars a year a month for each of these or 10 billion a year. It's so trivial in cost. If I was PM Modi, I'd do be doing everything I can to get those as common services. And at that point, you know, because AI is doing the work, you don't care about economic efficiency. Your government is as efficient as private enterprise in these services that can be made into AI. And they should be. They're so accessible today. They'll always be available. You know, if you live in a village, you shouldn't have to go take a day's journey to go get a basic medical checkup and the doctor sees you for 5 minutes and then you spend a day getting back to your village. It just shouldn't. Mhm. And 10 years ago in this document I wrote about the fact at some point in the future much more we are 5 minutes from Stanford hospital and I wrote about the fact that a village in India I will get better cardiac advice cardiac care than I can get at Stanford because Stanford will still in 15 years have their cardiologists and in the village there'll be AI almost certainly. True. So should the government include all of these services or as many of these services for free? They can't include everything. Housing will still be a material thing and so you can't give it away for free. But the software based services that depend on expertise. Personal lawyers for everybody, personal tutors for every child or adult, personal medical care advice. You know, if you need surgery or medicine, you still need a physical thing. But half the economy could be covered in almost free services from the government. And to be honest, I'd love to do that in India, right? It's such a no-brainer. And make it available in the next 5 years. But let's talk about what entrepreneurs have as opportunities. I get away into this. No, I heard you and Bill debate this. Why does regulation not allow doctors in the UK? I think you were making a case for Yeah. Yeah. I heard you make that debate. Look, mental health services aren't available in India. In the UK, we have something that's used by 40% of all NHS mental health clinics to intake patients. What does intaking a patient mean? a conver a therapist talk to them and classify their mental illness. The AI is much more accurate than the human therapists. 93% accuracy for talk-based therapy kinds of conditions. Uh are you bipolar? Are you schizophrenic? Are you depressed? Um u and AI can do the therapy. It should be scaled infinitely in India and it's kind of thing people may be afraid to go or embarrassed to go ask for services and there aren't enough therapists in India to meet everybody's needs but the AI can offer it for free. So in a way you're also saying that UBI is a inevitability. I think some form of income redistribution by 2050 will be absolutely essential everywhere in the world. Do you think it'll be income redistribution or will it be shoring up the bottom part of the population? There's many ways to get there. You could give everybody income Mhm. for not working. Mhm. The question is where do you get that from? Mhm. There's probably another way which is my favorite way is to deflate the economy which is what America is doing. Well, if you do excess spending, you'll get def inflation not deflation. But if a lot of services become free, you'll have a deflationary economy. So in my essay on AI dystopia or utopia Mhm. I talk about in the US I believe 20 25 years from now it could be that $10,000 today uh to in 2050 buys more goods and services that you need whether it's food or housing or medical services or entertainment or education then then $50,000 buys today because the services will be provided provided by machines which don't inflate. Yeah. You'll have excessive production. So deflationary prices. You're no longer constrained by inputs to get outputs in many areas. In some areas you'll still have inputs but you'll have much more input. Isn't the cost of a service also dependent on purchasing power? Like how much I am willing to pay relative to Vod? Yeah. Except if there's infinite supply. If there's an infinite supply of doctors, what do you think a doctor will cost? I think Adam Smith like you mentioned earlier also spoke about the marginal utility of things wherein one agentic doctor, the first one that is created and is free has X in value. The second, the third, the fourth proportionately have lower and lower value to a point where they have no value. But overnight if I created a billion doctors for India which is entirely feasible what happens they become near free the cost of computing or the cost of power to run a computer right right same thing happens in education same thing happens in legal does the cost of comput AI ever like your brain has a cost of compute right the amount of energy it takes to produce is an output. Let's say that today that is far cheaper than how much a AI is taking. When do you think that crossover happens when the cost of compute in a system becomes less? This is a complex question because at some level the cost will decline. Mhm. But you won't take advantage in efficiency in cost but you'll take it in more performance. M so if everybody has a super assistant that's a if your personal housekeeper is a PhD in every subject that's sort of the world to imagine I know it sounds crazy but look I think the more interesting question for your audience is what's one important question which you asked how do you pick a job we talked about that the other question to ask is what job should I take now and what company can I start? Yeah. And for the next 10 years, the following is true. Anybody in any industry not using AI will be obsoleted by somebody who's using AI. Mhm. So if I'm an entrepreneur in India today, I say what's my next move? Say where can I apply AI that obsoletes the service either in cost or in performance or in quality that somebody's providing without AI and beat them at it. I think that's the metric for every entrepreneur. If say 10 entrepreneurs hear that and they and there will be cans who hear that yeah 100%. And they all use the same means to approach this problem and AI is as democratic as it is right now. Wouldn't they all 10 arrive at the same solution? Um I think there's massive difference in the quality of entrepreneurs and the outcome will be a result of the quality of the entrepreneur how how they think from first principles how strategically they think almost certainly the people who only think a year out will be obsoleted by the people who think what do I want to build in 5 years. Mhm. Um but what can I sell next year? What can but where do I want to head in 5 years? Swallowing is a good analogy for entrepreneurs that I love. Imagine you want to climb Mount Everest. Mhm. And you have two people setting out. Mhm. And one says, \"I'll get to base camp.\" Mhm. Then to camp one, camp two, camp three. I think there's camp four, and then the peak, right? Um, it's not a straight path, right? Another entrepreneur says, \"I'm going to get the most revenue in year two.\" Mhm. Year one and year two. They won't go to camp one uh base camp or camp one. They'll pick the highest peak that doesn't then lead to something beyond. H the path to Everest through these camps is very strategically picked to have the long-term vision of getting to a uh to Everest. Most people maximize revenue for the short term and are not thinking strategically. So the strategic entrepreneurs will do better. The entrepreneurs who pick better employees who help them think through strategy will do better. So people selection or team building will become the most important characteristic where the AI technology is democratized if you believe it's democratized um which investor you pick do they have a short-term orientation or a long-term orient makes a dramatic difference what kind of advice you get most of the advice most entrepreneurs get is bad so if you Google 90% of venture capitalists add no value my name pops up because I've over said this for the last 25 years. I see such bad advice being given or short-term advice being given by investors. So picking your investors right, picking your employees, right? Those make a huge difference when things go wrong. Do you get scared and retract or pick a better strategy to survive and be more strategic? Do you think from first principle? All those things are massive differentiators. I think the shortage today is not of technology or capital. It's of great entrepreneurs who know how to make these choices. The single most important decision an entrepreneur makes is who's the advice to trust on what topic because they'll get advice from lots of people. Everybody does. Most of it is not good advice. And so I feel bad for entrepreneurs who get bad advice, but in the end they're responsible for deciding what advice to take. It's the most important decision they make. Do you need an entrepreneur? Then if you can model for the behavior that successful entrepreneurs like you speak about a few often if you can model for all their behavior and put it in a model and throw out outcomes like they were making the decision why do you then need the entrepreneur? Um why do you need venture capital? You know are we there today? No. Might we be there in 10 years? Maybe. Right. Uh, one of my speculations on the internet on Twitter has been when will the first billion dollar company that's only has 10 employees be started or has it already started? I think that's a valid question and sometime in the next 10 years we will see a company with a billion dollars of revenue that has only 10 employees. Whether it's already been started or will be started, I don't know. So, Vinod, I've been spending a lot of time with my team trying to come up with a thesis of what sectors might do better than others as this change in the world happens while it occurs. Some of the things that we've we've been digging data up around are things like the world will be older and sicker and people will have lesser kids than they're having or were having 10 years ago. When people have more time and discretionary spending power, they go back to their innate programming of wanting to speculate. So speculative businesses might do better. Do you have thoughts on these or opinions like this if you're wrong? On the entrepreneur side, I look at the question who thinks from first principles. Mhm. Who's not scared of hardship? Mhm. Because the entrepreneurial roller coaster has lots of highs and lows. Um, and who has the fastest learning rate. Mhm. Right. If they are fast learner, they'll adapt to the world as it changes. And that may be the most important characteristic of an entrepreneur. Yeah. I'm making the assumption that you're a faster learner than everyone else here. And I want to know what you've adapted to now that I might not be seeing yet. Well, I don't think people believe this world I'm describing. So if you look at my AI dystopia or utopia paper paper, most of the world I'm talking about is not something people believe. But that's natural cuz I feel like humans are programmed to worry a lot more about fear than think of the gain that they're getting twice as much according to Kman. But not everybody is not all humans. And that those are the people who will do well who are optimistic about the future and then persistent through real hardship of the ups and downs to make the passion they have happen. Right. Like we we have a company that's building public transit based on self-driving. Mhm. Where the vehicles become small and personal. You don't need a DTC bus in New Delhi. Mhm. To carry people. It can be a twoperson pod. Mhm. That drives itself from A to B. I actually have a personal question around this. For the last couple of years, I had come up I almost made an assumption that mobility will move to electric from IC fossil fuel based and I bet on everything from scooter companies to car truck bus even a flying taxi company but the adoption to EV in this last cycle seems to be slowing down. Do you agree with that thesis that all vehicle all mobility will be electric in nature and if yes why is it slowing down on land? Yes. Right. Almost certainly. Why is it slowing down the pace of ad adoption? You know look anytime you're an incumbent you want to slow things down. It's to your advantage that things change slowly because you adapt more slowly. And so incumbents always do that. And there's always fits and starts. It's never a straight line. But I can't see, you know, the some of the US companies are slowing down. But what's happening? BYD in China is the fastest growing company in the automotive world. Actually, even in India, a lot of companies are slowing down. Yeah. And that may be, but that doesn't change eventually where it'll get to. Yeah, I hope so, too. But yeah, I'm pretty certain that'll happen. Mhm. But the more the uncertainty, the harder it is to pick the right company to invest in. Right. Do you think energy and data centers as a business sufficient leg room and tailwinds to be if I were 22 and starting off to spend a decade in them? By energy I don't mean the means of generating energy. It could be fusion. It could be something else. But focusing on energy, you know, I would say there's some combination of where your passion is and expertise. Passion counts for more than most people think, right? Uh because you persist through ups and downs, and if you don't have passion, you give up. It's like you don't give up on your religion just because you had a hard time. M uh so someone wise once said a emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion once you developed a clear understanding of it. So you're not really it's very hard to be passionate about something that you've understood. Religion could fall in that territory. Nobody can truly understand it. And I've heard you in a in interviews say that passion is not necessarily the pivotal force that should define which sector you should work in. So I I think in the world of the past I used to tell kids when the advice you get is follow your passion I would say follow your passion if you're willing to starve and not make a living for your family. Live on a beach in a heart and stuff. I remember you saying this. Yeah. So you can go surfing and you can absolutely go live in Hawaii and survive, but you're not paying for a Stanford education for your kids, right? If you're surfing. Yeah. So you have to be realistic about it may still be a good trade-off, but everybody has to be explicit on what tradeoff they're making. If you bet your life on being the best cricketer, you don't make it, then you're a waiter, right? Are you willing to take a 0.0001 probability you'll be a world-class cricketer on the Indian cricket team or and and the rest of the probability you're a waiter? Mhm. Uh that's a choice you get to make. Uh that used to be true. I think we will go in a world where you can pursue much more of your passion. M I think that will change and that will where AI will free humanity to pursue what they're interested in and to change your passion if it changes over time. Right. My passions aren't the same from when I was 20. Yeah. Fair. In all that you're saying, Venod, you you're coming across very optimistic and utopian about this whole thing. I know you don't believe in bubbles per se, but as an investor, you have seen the many cycles, many more than I have. Do you think we could be in in a bubble today and overestimating I'm not saying overestimating the change, but the pace or the rate of change? I would make the following differentiation. Mhm. Investment is a different thing than building. Mhm. So when you're an investor in by and large you're competing with other investors that have only two emotions fear and greed right and so every time there's an opportunity rich space you get a bubble um if you look at the dot bubble in 1998 or So if you look at stock prices, they went up and then they collapsed and then they normalized. Yeah. But I don't look at that world because I don't think of myself as an investor. I say what happened to internet traffic. You can't tell where the bubble is by looking at internet traffic. Okay. Uh the one of the original bubbles was in the 1830s in England when railroads first came and you got you got the right to build a railroad between two cities. You could offer scripts. Mhm. Essentially do a stock an IPO. Mhm. Um and of course there was a huge bubble in script prices and then a collapse. Mhm. But same thing if you look at the miles of railroad built you can't tell when the bubble was in the 1830s. So what is reality for you? To me the reality is internet traffic, miles of railroad build AI applications. AI valuations isn't something I worry about but there surely will be a bubble. uh almost certainly will be or will will be or we are in one right uh I like to say even in 2025 most investments that are made will lose money right most the vast majority I might even guess north of 80%. M but more money will be made than lost. So the few things that succeed are playing in such large markets. It's the same issue of there's 10 startups. Mhm. One will make more money than the other nine lose in every area. of the next thousand startups, 990 can lose money and you can still make money by investing in the right portfolio. So I do think we will see that I do think we will see a collapse in valuations most likely. You can't never be certain but it's such a large market we are playing in such a large global transformation that there will be many more opportunities than we've seen ever before and that's good news for entrepreneurs and almost certainly most of this won't be done by large companies. Do you have a view on crypto and blockchains? They're not allowed in India. It's a it's a world where we have seen sudden adoption in the west and some neighbors of ours. But again, as you've seen, crypto has been a function of politics, not of reality. You don't think? I I think there's very different worlds of crypto. Mhm. There's cryptocurrency very very different than the blockchain. Mhm. The blockchain has a lot of uses. Mhm. And if you said to me, will we see adoption of stable coins? Absolutely. It makes total sense to adapt stable coins. Okay. Every economy should have a stable coin. The Indian government should issue a stable coin and then great place to do it with the Aadhaar system. But don't you think something is wrong with the premise that you didn't trust regulation in the formal economy? So you created a blockchain outside and a crypto on top of it. Now if you denominate the stable coin with the same dollar or the same currency, aren't you like going around in a circle? Here's the problem. When you don't have trust Mhm. When is the blockchain important? when you don't have centralized trust. Yeah. Okay. I don't think distributed trust works across borders in all areas all together. Mhm. So the vast majority of uses of crypto are illegal stuff. Gun trades, drug trades, uh sex trafficking, arms trades. It's the last use of crypto or people in Argentina trying to get their money out of the country or in China people trying to get their money out of the country. So in some places they're doing exactly what the global economy would want them to do which the government doesn't want them to do. Um but it's mostly illegal and then there's speculation and of course related to that fraud. Are there good uses for the blockchain of distributed trust? Yes, we have a company building a cell phone network based on distributed trust. Uh, everybody can contribute their own access point. Right now, that's there's another company building Google Maps competitor based on how much you contribute to mapping. Yeah. Like there's there's lots of good uses for the stable coin, but there's lots of bad uses. Mhm. The problem is the bad uses prevent the good uses and so stable coins is a currency mechanism is better than speculation and from that lens the banking industry will likely get disrupted sooner than later with stable coins. It would be yes. Yeah. The cost of transaction and the Yeah. And UBI's UPI has started to do that in India but it should be much much cheaper. And you know look you don't need to have the whole legal system you can have software contracts for at least half the things for which you have a legal system around contracts right so software contracts really good use of the blockchain. Mhm. automatic settlement of the contracts financially really good use of the blockchains. So I hope those come up specifically to your home country Venod of India which has a disproportionately high number of IT services being exported. I can't remember the number but somewhere around 200 billion. What do we do? How do we become I think it's very you know BO as a business will disappear. Yeah. Software IT services will mostly disappear. Disappear means transform pretty radically. Whether some of those companies can transform or not will determine whether they survive or not. What do you suspect? Will they will the incumbents transform? Today I see them adjusting incrementally not radically. Here's the problem, right? If I can do a system integration service for 1/5if the cost, uh the customer will always take one. Mhm. Modular trust. So will some of these vendors drop their prices by 5x or 80% or at least by 60%. Uh and then expand their services. Hard to tell. I do apologize. I have Thank you. Thank you for doing this, Veno. This was fun. Thank you for having us. This was fun, but I'm happy to catch up sometime. Yeah, 100%. We'll do it."

    "transcript": "Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] If you were to describe Ted the human in three words, what would the three words be? [Music] Hi Ted. Thank you. Good. Thanks for having me. Thank you for coming. Uh so you've been in India for 12 hours now. About about 12 hours. So how does it feel? I love being coming to India so much and it's I never get enough time here. Usually I come and I've got to they've got me working and grinding me out and then shoot me back out back in the sky. But it's a it's a it's I love the energy of India. What have you done so far today? Today I uh came in I met with the ministers and I met I went to the waves conference and spoke on stage and was interviewed. Uh do you have a favorite creator in India? That's like you know we work with so many it'd be like picking your kids but you know picking your favorite child almost. But I have to tell you early early in coming to India I met uh Shah Ruk Khan right away early and we just he hosted a very nice little dinner for for me and we just hit it off immediately and uh I've come back since and my with my wife and we've had a a nice times together. Uh he we visited with each other in Los Angeles when his son was in school. Uh so we got to go out to dinner. So going having dinner with Sharakhan in India is much different than having dinner with him in in Los Angeles. Uh but so I would say I mean that's probably who someone I know the most and really enjoy working with. So you've been at Netflix forever. 25 years this this just recently past 25th my past my 25th year anniversary. I have watched a lot of your interviews probably most of them. Sorry, I know Reed a little bit. Yeah, cuz we're in the Gates pledge together. So, we have one offsite we do every year which Gates organizes. And funnily enough, me and him did a speaking session last year, not on camera, and I was asking him a bunch of questions on the on a lot of the same stuff like where is content the media space today and where will it be at tomorrow? And I've been reading about the story of Netflix and how many pivots you've had from starting off one way to becoming another thing to becoming another thing and maybe you're another thing tomorrow altogether again. Uh would you like to tell me the story in your words? You've been there almost from the beginning as Yeah. I I I met Reed in 1999, October of 1999. and he I I had I was in the home video business for many years before. Um I knew of Netflix because I bought a DVD player and I opened up the box and there was a card in there to join this thing called Netflix and you could rent DVDs through the mail. Not subscription yet. It was back you just rent them one at a time. Yeah. And I never I thought that's clever, you know, that thought and I never really thought about it again much. And then a friend of mine who I knew through the home video distribution was working at Netflix and Reed was trying to they were trying the business was growing. They needed more inventory all the time. They had burned through all the cash. Uh and we need and basically the company at the time was buying all the DVDs from Walmart and Best Buy and that kind of thing. And um and he really was trying to figure out just how the distribution system worked. So this guy Mitch said, \"Oh, you um this guy Ted, he just did a deal with the studios where they could you could do revenue share where you don't pay for the movies. They you just pay every time they rent.\" And Reed goes, \"Oh, we should talk to him.\" So he introduced us and uh I did What year was this? This was in 1999. Mhm. And I was working for a company called West Coast Video at the time, which is like a a smaller version of Hollywood or Blockbuster Video, you know. Um, and I did these deals for the same reason Netflix needed them. We had no cash. My business was very bad. And he he uh so he I did what was my first e-commerce transaction of any kind, which was I went and bought an airline ticket to fly to San Jose to go meet Reed. Um, and there was a kind of a warehouse, you know, of an office and I went in and met with him. There was very few people in there at the time. and he laid out his vision for Netflix, which was almost exactly like it is right now. Mhm. Um it would be all digital. Uh there would be no, you know, the the DVD through the mail thing was just that's the cheapest way to move bits from here to there right now. Uh it'll take takes a couple of days, but it's very cheap and pretty pretty soon the internet will be almost free to distribute on and we'll move very fast and we'll be able to do all this. uh that we talked about it downloading instead of streaming at the time because that's streaming didn't really quite exist yet. Um but that's the it would be global because the internet would enable global distribution in ways that physical media would would could never do. Um and it sounded a little crazy to me uh in October of 1999 because he said that all entertainment will come into the home on the internet. Mhm. You know this is at a time when no entertainment was coming into the home on the internet. Um, but so in hindsight, of course, it was very visionary. I actually just thought he was kind of maybe maybe not uh not fully playing with all all his marbles maybe. Uh because in fact, I had tried to watch video on the internet before and it's very it was terrible. Yeah. And I just said I I didn't see that it was going to get from point A to point B anytime soon. And he said to me, \"Well, there's a thing called Moore's law. The internet's going to get f twice as fast at half the price every 18 months.\" And that's exactly what happened. And I um he offered me the job to come to work at Netflix to run the purchasing and programming and at the time I didn't I wasn't looking for a job so I just went back to work and um he offered me the position. Why purchasing in programming? You had no background in that, right? Uh yeah, I did at the the at the video in video distribution. I I ran distribution from the the studios to the stores and then at the time that I met Reed, I was at West Coast Video where I was doing the programming, marketing and publicity and all the all the purchasing for the stores. He's no longer active. Is he Reed? Like when I spoke to him last year, he was more like Yeah. retirement phase. Yeah. He just recently uh stepped down from executive chair to chair of our board. So he's very helpful all the time. I you know, we call him regularly for advice and input. I went and visited him at Powder Mountain a couple weeks ago and Right. and I just had a board meeting with him last week. So, he's he is an unbelievable resource, but um but at the time I wasn't sure if he was a crazy person or if he was the next coming. So, he um he kept calling though and said, you know, we you should come work here. We we're we're going to do exciting things. And I said, look at I'm this you just got me at a bad time. And he said, why is that? And I said I went I described what was happening at my current job which was the we had bought another company. They were both in very bad shape and uh and I was I was renegotiating all my deals with the studios and all these things. And he said this is classic greed. He goes, \"It sounds like they really need you there.\" And I go, \"Yeah, yeah, that's what's going on really.\" And he goes, \"Well, they need you in third world countries feeding starving children. Why aren't you doing that?\" \"Yeah, it's true.\" I started laughing and I said I'd take the job because I liked them. I like that I like that approach. So that was my beginning and Reed had started the company um with this vision to get there and at the time they were doing all kinds of things. They were selling po posters or transactional rental. When I got there they had just started doing the subscription when I got there. Right. So when Reed started the company with this other person Mark Rand uh I remember reading the story about them when he came back and took over the company as a CEO. Reed had already taken another company public. Yeah. And he asked Mark to step down and took over this culture of hiring testing people quickly. Yeah. and firing either very quickly or the ones that manage to stay in the ecosystem get paid a lot of money. It's a very different culture from many other corporations that have been built. Does that work for Netflix? It works very well for Netflix. I felt like it was a mostly because it was articulated when you came in and Reed's vision for I remember at the time I joined including everyone who was stuffing envelopes there was probably 175 people and he was talking about talent density being an issue and I go talent density you got 175 people here what are you talking about and he goes I know but we're going to have we're going to have tens of thousands of people and tal talent density will really matter and and I didn't even really even understand the concept to be honest with you Right. And he said no the he said why do these companies these startups that start up and they get great and then they become big fat companies and fail. Why is that? Well the bigger you get the further the core the people are working out to get away from the core mission. You get hiring people who do who didn't start it who didn't it's not their passion maybe not even their core skill. Um and you start building into business so you can accommodate uh people who are not as good as the people you started with. Right. And then so so you don't want chaos. So you have a bunch of rules and then you start attracting people who like to work in places with a lot of rules. And then he said you can um you can idiot proof your business but then you're going to end up with a business full of idiots. So the idea was really focus on talent density and tell everybody up front you're going to have this is going to be a great place to work but that bar is going to be held very very high. Uh and if you can this is not a family, right? This is a sports team high performing sports team. He goes you know you wouldn't throw your brother out. He said but there's no shame of getting cut from a great team. You could a lot of great athletes get cut from a great team which is a good way good an interesting way to think about it. Is it still like that? It's the very opposite of how things work in India cuz we are largely familyowned businesses. So you know the father retires, the kids take over, the cousins are there, the sisters, the brothers, all of them together. I'm trying to like evaluate one versus the other and see what works for one and doesn't for another. I mean, it depends heavily on what you're doing, right? So, I think that what we were doing depended on an incredible amount of great execution. Um, bu building things that worked in very, you know, fixing big hairy problems. And for for engineers, you had to have a an attractive enough problem for them to come solve and a big enough price, right? So for if you're doing that and and you know that there's going to be competitors and they're going to get good at it, you need to be better at better at it than they are or faster than they are. So you know someone has got to be responsible for better, faster, cheaper all the time and you have to hold everyone's, you know, to a very high bar to do that, right? You were always into journalism, Ted. This is what I read that in college you ran the newspaper, you were the editor. You wanted to be a journalist growing up. I did as a as a kid. I really admired journalism. I I uh I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and there's a there was a a reporter, his name was Don BS, and he was doing a story about he was covering the a story about the mob the mob in Arizona, mobsters, and he got blown up and killed in his car. And I just I remember that vividly, that story, even as a very young man, thinking that's all he had to do was not write that story and they wouldn't have killed him. and he had to write the story and I just thought that that that was a level of heroes of heroics that I didn't see in other things. So I uh set out to be a journalist and um started writing for the you know got in the school newspaper became the editor of the school newspaper and then went to two years of community college uh where I also mostly just worked on the newspaper and didn't go to class. Uh, so but they I I realized somewhere around my second year of community college that I probably was never going to be a professional journalist. I wasn't that good. I wasn't that good. I don't I don't know how I got that far from age 10 to 19 or so uh without anyone telling me that I was just an okay writer. And what was the trigger emotion like the hero element of writing about something that everybody is scared to write about? Is that the hero element or being able to depict a event in a manner that is more comprehendable than most? I think um some version of being a real source of truth I think is a real commendable thing in a society. Why is that? Being able to tell the truth. Is there such a thing as truth? Yeah. Yeah. Everything is an interpretation from one lens or another, right? Yeah. You look at I definitely think that you um can watch two people can watch the same event and see two different things but those something happened and you can explore it from m multiple angles but yeah you what you can't do is say that didn't happen right okay so you grew up went to college worked in the school newspaper started working at a rental store met read started at Netflix when the rental store my first job. So, I was when I was going to school, I was working at the video store part-time. That was my part-time job. I paid my my I had to pay my own way through school. And uh the guy I met in the in the store, it was like a serendipitous thing. My my mom, we I thought we were poor. Like I always think that I thought because our we lived poorly. We had um our utilities would get turned off all the time. So, we either if we had the electricity on, we didn't have the water, the water was off, the phone was off or one of these things. But but my mom always had these like luxury things. So she would so she was just bad with money. We weren't that poor really. But she had like she bought the first person I know who bought a VCR and there was no reason to even own a VCR yet. You know there weren't video stores yet. So you are you the opposite of that? Are you a frugal person when it comes to family? I think um when it comes to family yeah like I feel like whatever my parents were Yeah. whatever they had excess of as a quality as an emotional quality I might overcompensate on the other end. I think when it comes to family I'm generous when it comes to my per me personally I'm frugal like I don't spend a lot on things for myself. Why why is that? I see this in a lot of people where I'm not saying your family is a patriarchy. I know your wife is a very accomplished person who was an ambassador and all of that but I see a lot of people for the lack of a better word the patriarch the male bread winner the primary bread winner of the family is generally putting on the projection or the mask of frugality is it to subconsciously project onto the other family members that you are doing more by also contributing in that manner. Is it self- serving? You think being being everything in life is self- serving, don't you think? Yeah, I think so. I think so. Yeah. Look, some of it is ro you you think you're role modeling it. Yeah. Um part of it is like for me it's like um people who grow up in the depression and they get then they later on have plenty, but you still think you could lose it all the time. Yeah, but I mean about like we would we would have these periods growing up where we lived very well, went on a nice vacation, everything and then come home and we're broke. So I this this sense of that you could lose it is not never far from me. If you were to describe Ted the human in three words, what would the three words be? Um I'll go back to creative because I think it's the thing I pride myself on. Uh uh curious. Mhm. and honest. I mean curious, you could say searching instead of curious, but yeah, there those are all nice. Those are all good. Those are all positive attributes, I guess. Honest about everything I can be. One thing that is wrong with the world today. Uh lack of trust because probably because of the internet. I mean just the division of the division of things where you just start um probably this it goes back further than the internet obviously it goes back for me growing up in America um this journalist that I that I so admired um they probably started it um by bringing down Nixon by telling the truth right which then people stopped having faith in systems and hierarchies uh and then so I I often had the arguments with Reed when I would said say that when Walter Kankite was the news and everybody tuned into the news to hear that from Walter Kankite u that the world was a better place when there was one source of truth even if it was wrong 25% of the time is that happening today people don't believe don't believe any I mean a lot of people don't believe anything and no one believes everything uh and I don't know that we that's made the world a better place in some ways how much of the world today Ted is narrative I feel Like there is a online world, there is a real world and there is another world where our families live in and where we are more ourselves than we are in the other places. A lot of perception of how we are viewed in society has become a factor of the online world because everybody's online so much of the time. Yeah. What do you think about that? Well, it's almost like once you and I are having a conversation right now, I see the camera right there. Yeah. I know this is going to be recorded and played for other people. Would you say something differently if you could manifest no cameras around and you could imagine that they didn't exist? I I think I I think I would I mean I think I think I would would be material maybe say things materially different, right? But I but um but I am aware of it and so which changes the dynamic of the situation. So, so I think that because we're having this conversation and because it's being filmed u and it's going to exist on the internet for for a long time, uh that people, you know, people will be slightly guarded. And so then therefore I know that when I see anything on the internet, on television, anywhere that is slightly manufactured, slightly guarded and every once in a while when you see something that is not, it's a re it's it's a marvel. It's a revelation when you see something that is authentic and real. Maybe today is such a day. I hope so. I think so. I will. I promise to try. I promise to be. Yeah. So, you joined Netflix and then you were competing initially with Blockbuster. Blockbuster was as a big a competitor as we could have imagined when back then. Yeah. How was that? How was that journey? Here is this behemoth which was what a $8 billion company back then. And what was unimaginable that we could grow to $8 billion? An $8 billion in 2003 is like I don't know a hundred billion dollars today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and they were global. They were really the only global the only thing that we were aspiring to do. Blockbuster was the only company doing it. A real global entertainment brand, right? Disney for sure, but they were also a very specific narrow niche. But yeah. So when you started delivering DVDs to people's homes, mail order audio or whatever, right? used to take two three weeks is what I read. Yeah. Um we had uh beginning we only had one center in California, right? And it would take 3 to 5 days to get to the east coast. Uh and in California got one day service all the time. So uh it took it took us a while to figure out that the people in California liked it much better than the people in New York. So we started opening centers around the country so that we can get one day service. Eventually when the at the peak of the DVD business, we were doing one day delivery to everywhere in the country. And I I was reading this case study which said that what did not work for blockbusters specifically is the late fees. And uh I mean there is this guy who talks about Daniel Kman who wrote this book thinking fast and slow who speaks about when you look back at a memory the thing that you remember is the peak pain or the peak joy in the memory. Yeah. The returning a DVD after 10 days and paying that $3 a day late fee. Yeah. wiped out all the joy of it. Yeah. Wiped out all the joy of Blockbuster. Now, when you built competition for Blockbuster, what did you do to ensure that that peak pain is not there? How did you mitigate that? So, you know, back in the we talk about renting a going to the video rental store and I I always joke with my kids that that's like being a blacksmith. That's a job that doesn't exist anymore. Um but I said that you that business was never a good customer satisfaction business. Almost nobody who walked in the door got the movie they came for. So it became the second choice business. Uh I always called it the manage dissatisfaction. Uh so you a you didn't get what you came for, right? And then b when you brought it back if you were a day late you had to pay a fee and that's all you remember. So now there nothing about this was great but then you come back Friday night and do it all over again. Um, so for us, we're looking at like what is the thing uh that people really hate about this and because we're trying to get them to do something completely different and it that late fee was their biggest counterposition which was there's never a late fee because it's just you keep it as long as you want. You just don't get another one till you return it. And you had three movies at home all the time. So you never really had to rush out and make a you can make all your decisions a week ahead. And if you give us a list, we'll give you everything on your list. May maybe not in the same order you asked for it, but you'll get everything on your list. So, it took care of the first choice problem. It took care of the late fee problem. Uh we had everything ever published on DVD, so you had the selection and choice. Uh and then the really valuable thing was the recommendations that we would help you find something you loved. And I'd learned so much working in that in the first little video store I worked in. I learned lessons that I carried into Netflix for years. Um biggest one for me was uh like um Trade Radius. So we I we used to buy the movies for the store and I like art films and I like Woody Allen comedies and uh and Arizona was not didn't wasn't a lot of fans of kind of the New York coastal comedy. So I would buy these movies that I loved and I'd say why we can't we can't support because it used to be you buy the tape for $100 and you rent it out for $5 a night. you hope you make enough money to pay the $100 $100 back. These tapes would never pay back and it used to make me crazy and I figured out there are plenty of Woody Allen fans in the country. There's not enough in the neighborhood that goes to come to this store. So if if you had one cop 1,000 copies of a movie in a store, none of them make money. If you had one copy in a thousand stores all over the United States, they'd all make money. So that was this kind of idea. And then Netflix became this kind of national footprint inventory. So we can support very small niches and or even more importantly we could roll up small niches into big ones. So that's a for me was one of the biggest lessons that we learned there. The other one was people really cared about this this choice thing. They really cared about find picking something that that and I would always puzzled me because it was a $ five dollar transaction and people would spend an hour in the store walking and reading all the boxes and trying to figure out and finally I would start asking people in the store like why uh why are you spending so much time and trying to pick a movie and they said well I like how it makes me feel if I pick the movie and everyone likes it. It says a lot about me. Mhm. So there's a there's a whole psychology to how you pick and finding things you like that people value almost as a human being as much as a a movie lover. Is that still true? Like people feel like they get judged by the content they consume? I do. It's almost a projection thing again. Yeah. Like I think there's there's we used to do this thing uh where you could put your the things that were in your DVD queue. you could p, you know, push a button and put it on your Facebook profile, your And there were some people who um wanted you to see their queue and they didn't care about yours at all. So that's that that's the thing about it would say something about their personality that you'll think more of me if these movies are good. It's a bit like people posting pictures of the books they're reading on social media. Yeah. Which they might not be reading. Yes. But in some cases, they're maybe recommending the book because it moved them so much. Or in other ones, they might just be saying, \"No, look what I'm reading.\" Yeah. The former might happen a lot more than the latter, I presume. Well, the other telling one for us on this one was the movies. We looked at how long people kept movies and the movies that stayed out the longest are the ones that people are putting off watching, you know. So, which sat on top of the TV the longest and it was Gone with the Wind and Citizen Kane and all the greats that they thought they had to watch and should watch, right? They never got around to them, but they like the idea that they could. That's so interesting though. Even in society today, a lot of our choices are less for us, but more to fit into the mold of the projection that we are putting out. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like I would that is one of the cool things about the internet I think that people were able to find their tribes right you know they were able to find the people who like the quirky thing that I like you know right do people find their tribes are they they have a means of finding the tribe that is cool at that point of time I think they do yeah they do yeah in a world today where like back then choice and what one should watch somebody recommending that or giving someone a 100 titles or a million titles to choose from was a big thing. Do you think the world is moving today in a direction where I don't want a million choices? I want five choices and I want you to tell me which the five best choices are. I mean, that's part of the bad, right? Is that these kind of helping you pick the worst thing you can give somebody you think the worst thing would be a list of 100 movies, but the worst thing is a list of a thousand movies. Yeah. So, but actually a curated list of five is unbelievably valuable. Is that where you might go tomorrow? Well, it it isn't. It wouldn't be us doing it. So, you even in these ways we show you things today, we have to have a lot of very high confidence to only show you those things. So, we'd still show you things that we have lower confidence that you're going to love. But, um but the things that are most prominent are the things we're the most confident you're going to love. What is a win for you? Like if I am a Netflix subscriber, I pay my $5 fee. When I land on a Netflix screen, the homepage, and you're watching me land there, what's a win for you, and what is a loss for you? Is there something you want me to click? No, we just want you to pick the movie that you're going to really love. The thing that we really value is when you push play, do you stay? So, do you keep watching it all the way through? It's a good indicator that you like it. I mean, I'm I'm taking a leap that people It's a subscription service, so there's no extra fee. You can turn it off and watch something else, but people tend to watch the things that they like more of and then turn off the things they don't. So, if you're turning it off, it was a bad pick. And and I think what they find is is that the more and the more we get the right choice in front of you, the longer you stay a member. So, um, for us, a fail might be that people come on and just click all over the place and search and find something that they don't like and push play and turn it off. That's a bad we failed them in that in that transaction. In a world where you also produce and curate and distribute content, wouldn't a win for you be when I click a I click on a piece of content that you have produced versus sourced? It would be financially but not if you didn't like it. So I don't want me making you or aiding pushing you towards something you don't like is a very short relationship. Right. So Ted, most of our audience are people who want to build a business in the space of media and content. We cater to the entrepreneurheavy crowd. Uh so what I want to take away from today are some great insights of what might be lowhanging fruit to build in media. Um I could be a content creator. I could be somebody aspiring to build a platform. I could be somebody who is an actor, a director, somebody who works in the space of media. I could be a podcaster, a YouTuber, a independent musician, everything. Yeah. So if I were to largely categorize media today, I was trying to write down and I wrote down print media, what you did first. Broadcast media, what I grew up on, uh TV with pre-programmed. Yeah. news media uh the news channels big ticket cinemas long for TV shows I mean the TV series sport the theater business gaming reality TV if TED was not part of Netflix but you knew all that you have learned in the Netflix journey and you had $100 to invest is there one particular particular division where you would put your money behind binary $100. You can only put it or not. Just just a bet or not bet. Yeah. What's the What's the goal? To make a return. To make a return. Um I would say that uh producing content today is you're going to get the great return because the delivery models are evolving so rapidly and the monetization is evolving so rapidly. Um, so was you didn't have streaming as its own separate category there? But what I think the great news of that is is that's a viable business model to keep making content to make keep making programming. So that's and when you say make programming, are you talking about that me individually say I'm shooting this podcast? To me the the real value is how does it monetize and you can moni stream streaming in a subscription service at scale uh can effectively monetize almost any content. So you would put the money behind producing the content. Yeah. And is there a specific kind of content that you think has more tailwind than other kind of content? This is the I'm going to give you the cheap answer. Yeah. Good. You know what I think what people have such crazy diverse taste and the things that you like I may not like and vice versa. So the good version of what you're setting out to make is always going to work. But there's the the it's very broad. Uh so many things that we that the fact that Squid Game would be a global sensation like it is. It's completely unpredictable. I mean the Korea team who picked it Yeah. they knew it was going to be a big hit in Korea. They were right. Yeah. And it turns out those things that are big local hits, they have the best chance of traveling cuz they're very very good. But this weird, you know, you you might think, well, what what you ought to do is take a movie and get that guy from Squid Game and then get Shah Ruk Khan and then you get uh Brad Pitt and put them in a movie together and then you've got this hodgepodge thing that no one recognizes. It's not familiar to anybody and no one watches it. So, so this idea of, you know, authentically local storytelling being the most globally valuable is unintuitive but totally true. Familiarity is a good thing. Yeah. No, I think people will see, like I said, I think when you watch Squid Game, it's very fundamentally Korean storytelling. It's a, you know, Korean horror. It's uh there's nothing about it that is, you know, the the edges aren't shaved shaved down at all. Uh but people see something in it, you know, class, uh fairness, although those are very universal themes and they see the universal themes in it. You know, you think about this idea that how many there's not that many total stories in the world really. They're just told differently different variants of them. Uh they're all boiled down to some form of Shakespeare, you know, right? There's a movie called Canara. I don't know if you've heard of it. I know. I don't know but I don't. Yeah, it's a Canada movie where I come from Bangalore. Uh my hometown it's made there. Again, very folksy, very local. Yeah, it's very interesting you're saying that. So in a manner you're saying Bollywood should not try and sell or make the stories of Hollywood and Hollywood should not try and make the stories of Bollywood. Right. Which is not what is happening though. Yeah. Look, I got worried years ago that when everyone was make when when the China market opened up for America. Yeah. America was making movies for China. China is making movies for China. Who's making movies for America? Uh so for me it's like this idea that everything has to travel, everything has to be big. That's why you end up with a dispassionate relationship to movies. So local is a very interesting word. Yeah, everybody in this room is at the very core like each one of us deeply passionate about content from a different lens. Somebody might be viewing it through the lens of sitting behind a camera, someone's on audio, I might be speaking, someone else is doing something. So beyond local, what else can you tell us? Long form content, short form content, movie, TV show. So, I think that things have those lines are all blurring. I feel like the micro series. Was that micro series? That's a new word I heard. Yeah. Three minute shows, one episode a day. Yeah. The micro dramas and these things. Yeah. I I don't know that that's a it's fun. I don't know that that's a business yet. I've looked at it quite a bit. I I think that like a documentary particularly is something the way it fails mostly is a short that should have been a feature. a feature that should have been a short. Uh just picking the running time that's appropriate to the story you're telling. So the one thing that's great about a a series is an eight hour movie is probably not going to work, right? But sometimes there's eight hours of storytelling and doing it in 1 hour bytes or 30 minute byes is the right the perfect way to tell this story in eight hours and it has to be eight hours. You know, let the story lead every time and it doesn't matter. It it could be a eight hour movie. It might work right completely. Look at that. I watched um uh it's Adolescence from the UK which is very big big sensation now around the world. So if you watch the whole thing it's four hours long. It's only 40 minutes longer than the brutalist one movie. Right. Yeah. Can I also say Ted, it's very impressive that unlike many CEOs in your shoes, you're not selling the organization you belong to beyond a point, you know. Yeah. We interview a lot of people, especially Westerners who come to India who are constantly going back and following the dictat of the corporation that's sitting behind and it gets boring to people beyond a point. Yeah. Yeah. It's nice that you're being slightly candid. Okay. So, local during just slightly, just slightly for now. Okay. There's room to get better. Okay. I'll take the feedback. Okay. Local duration doesn't matter. Again, if I am 20 and I'm trying to build a career in media, I am not going to college. I'm grow I've grown up in Bangalore or in Bombay or in Chennai or a city in India. If I had a choice to focus on print the newspapers in India, join a streaming platform like yours, go into trying to join a production company, uh be do something in sport, do something in gaming. Is there career advice you can give a 20-year-old me? Where should I go? Where could the odds of success be the highest financial success? Well, first of all, I think the f we try to do is figure out I think the right first path is to get into work for one of the agencies agencies like like uh CIA, UTA, these agencies who represent talent management. um you learn more about the business in six months than anyone could teach you or that you could learn in any you'll get one little view of the world in any one of these jobs you're talking about where if you go into the agency business first that's actually the I read his book my coits uh that is almost run like a cult their people behave in the very family everybody has the same car in a certain level of management their families live next to each other Yeah, it's very cultish. They do work on percentages though. So it's a meritocracy in that you you get you move up the ladder by making more. So they work on a fixed percentage even without a contract, right? They don't sign contracts with their talent, right? But I actually funnily enough have a small partnership in a talent management agency here called Collective. I think it's the largest in India. I have spent some time in their office. I haven't learned much. Why do you say really? Well, I don't know if they enter if the if the culture is differently different here than it would be. The culture is very similar to the So, in the US, you will be on the phone with them negotiating listening to them negotiate the deal. You you know, the agents their their assistants are on the phones. They're actually listening to the to the calls and listening to the details of deals that otherwise they're just trying to scrape, you know, dig through the trash to read the turn of contracts. um where I think you can just learn, you learn more, you're more hands-on, you realize why things do and don't work and why deals fall apart, all those kind of things. And and so I think you just get more of a broad picture of the entertainment business. And then if you want to get into what you want to do particularly, I think you should find the thing that you're really really good at. And I think for a way my one of my life lessons back to my journalism versus executive um is I was passionate about being a journalist. I I just wasn't very good at it. If I would have I think if I would have been really good at it, I would have been even more passionate about it. And I would and the reason I dropped out of it even I said, \"Well, everyone I'm seeing ahead of me, none of them are doing very well in in life, you know, they're working in small markets and working their way up. And if you're going to do that, you've got to really love it. You know, struggle for 10 years and do all that.\" And versus if you just find something that you're really good at, you will excel and you'll feel good. You will get passionate at things that you're good at because you'll be proud of yourself for being good at them and you will excel at those things that you're really good at. And you figure that out by doing a lot of different things. That's what I mean about the agency giving you exposure to different things that you probably don't know that you're going to love or or that you're good at because you have never because you this is what your 20s are for. Yeah. You know, you're in your 20s, try things. Go out there and if you don't and if they don't work, quit or you know or you'll get fired maybe, but if you don't if you don't get fired, quit and try something else. You shouldn't be unhappy at work in your 20s. You should be moving on to the next thing in your 20s. Yeah. I'm going to digress a bit and ask you a question. A lot of people are freaked out by the fact or by the rumor that Netflix might soon produce theatrical movies. Don't the lines get blurred there? We're not doing that. We're not doing that. Some of our movies go to the theaters just as a tactical part of the release, but our business is the subscription entertainment business. So the the movies that we produce, we produce them for our subscription business. And I and I think, you know, but looking at the box office, box office is pretty healthy in in in India a little. It's down a bit. It's I think it's down. Yeah. Even today at precoid levels, net collections of all theaters. Yeah. In the US, it's down about 20% right now, but remember ticket prices are up 25%. So attendance is way down, right? Uh and I look at that as a sign from the consumers of what they want. And because uh average American consumer watches two movies a year in the theater, watches seven movies a month on Netflix. So I take that as a sign that they would like to watch movies at home. Thank you. So if I put them in the theater and then starve them, I I won't let you see this movie because I have to put in the theater for two months before. Um I don't know what that says to the people who gave me the money to make the movie in the first place. So the there's again another friend of mine called AJ. I was an investor in that company for a while. Uh runs the it used to be the largest chain but now they've combined to become the only chain of multiplexes in the country. It's called PVR and Inox together. So whenever me and AJ catch up, I'm always asking him what is next for the theater business? Uh the penetration of movie theaters in India is far lower than it is in the west. even lower than there fewer theaters. Much fewer. Yeah. Like I would say a vast majority of our country still does not have access to a movie theater. The experience where for $20 a movie, a family of three or four can be entertained in a safe environment with air conditioning and food if you choose to Yeah. access food and all of that for 3 hours or four [Music] hours. Uh it sounds very appetizing to me from an experience standpoint for a vast majority of India. But in theory it is not playing out like that maybe because I don't think movie theaters are doing as well as they were doing five or 10 years ago. And you know it's interesting almost everything else for like live events is back bigger than pre-COVID live concerts sporting events all these things all bigger. So I I actually think consumers go to the went to the went back to the theater and said this isn't much better than watching at home where you go to a concert it's a totally different experience than listening to a CD or you go to you know you go to a sporting events way different than watching a football game on television. uh and we're seeing the movie for most movies is pretty much it's not much better experience now depending on the size of the theater it may not be a better experience at all now you see a movie in a big IMAX room that's something and it's the right movie it's mind-blowing I love that that still exists AJ's business model yeah have you spoken to him AJ the largest multiplex I have not no we don't we don't really distribute theatrically so yeah but again for $20 in a threehour window. Yeah. Barring cricket maybe like somebody sitting at home watching a cricket match or actually watching Netflix for 3 hours or 4 hours. There aren't that many options for families, right? Like u if you had a choice would you buy into or short sell into any theater business today? I I don't want to I don't know their business that well. Yeah. It's a high fixed cost business, right? and that the and there's that the consumers have found substitutes for, right? Um, but again, I think that there's something that's really wonderful about seeing a big movie in the theater and enjoying it. Do you go, Ted? I do. I do. Yeah. They must just hate you when you get to, which was, but I don't go as often as I used to, but I because mostly because I'm just not finding Yeah. the the movies that I want to see there anymore. Yeah. The really affluent of audience with the most spending power also because the cost of television has gotten so democratized can afford large screen TVs at home, right? Can't can. Yeah, they can now. And it's getting cheaper and cheaper. Yeah. You know, it's cheaper to make a large screen TV now than it is to make a phone. Yeah. So, I think I think you know, people will go up that curve. Yeah. Yeah. So, what's the next big disruption here? It's a great question because you know the internet it's going to be tough to find one that's going to be as big as the internet was the disruption to entertainment like it was to many things right um I think it's going to likely to be less likely to be in distribution and be in creativity and you know some AI certainly part of it virtual production certainly part of it uh the way people can create u will can take things to a whole different level than they were you know every it it's moving very fast Um, and I'm not afraid of AI and I hope creators aren't afraid of create of AI because I actually think they're it's going to make great tools to tell stories even better and make it possible to make movies they couldn't before. Um, and I it not meant won't likely displace the things that humans are very particularly good at performance, emotion, uh, writing, all the things in the writing and the in the performance but things like uh the technology it takes to deage an actor. Mhm. Those tools have moved so fast now that versus five year when we did the Irishman, that technology was about probably $30 million of the budget was just the technology to do the deaging and it was very disruptive to the production cycle, you know, of uh what actors had to put on their face and all that kind of thing. Extra camera rigs, all kinds of different things. Uh today, we could do that exact film better for a fraction of that. Maybe the entire we just made a movie called Pedro Paramore. The cinematographer on that film on Irishman was the director of Pedro Paramore. He he basically was made this entire movie for less than the like than the deaging budget for the Irishman. What do you think of a world where AI has gotten to the point where I could just prompt and say that make a movie of Ted and Nikil having a conversation around topics like ABCDE E and it does it so well that Ted and Nikil are no longer required. What happens then? I um it's an interesting hypothetical. I don't know that that ever happens. I mean meaning that it's the the art of the prompt is also going to be a human skill. Now you think the prompts become self-training at some point. Yeah. Um it's interesting. You know the bigger thing I worry about is that the you put something in and the prompt will spit something will spit something out and you think no not like this like this not like this like this not like that like this. whether or not people stop taking the step of of saying not like this and just go with what the Yeah. But what what was spit out? Yeah. Um that that's that would be the danger. But it there won't be any need to it because I really think the things that it's going to do is lower the cost of doing things in a way that makes it possible to tell bigger and better stories and then but but still requires people to do that. Yeah. Because imagination and emotion uh are the things that really the in fact what AI is doing today is like the antithesis of imagination. It's take it's giving you the most predictable outcome uh based on these kind of rough ideas you're giving it. So that but I think those tools will become very much like visual effects tools or very much like uh computer animation. You know you're using the tools to tell the story and express yourself in a way that you couldn't before. And I think of the the leap forward from 2D handdrawn animation to CG animation is much bigger than the leap from we're going to experience with AI. And more animators today, those films are more expensive actually and employ more people and more creatives and they're better than they've ever been. Yeah. I was watching uh Lion King Mufasa. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. Isn't it great? Yeah. Yeah. You remember we just talked about theaters? Mhm. Is it crazy that when my kids are 28 and 30, when they were very little, I took them to see The Lion King on Broadway. I just looked up recently that thing has made that play has made more money than the film. Made billions of dollars. The play the play between the touring companies, everything else, it's made I think almost 10 billion dollars. Wow. Yeah. If you can invest in just that one, tough to call it. No, like before it happens. Yeah. Yeah. In terms of live, uh, my team was telling me that there was this episode of Black Mirror which was interactive and you could control the outcome you wanted to a certain extent. Bender Snatch. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that'll happen? I, you know, it wasn't, it was very interesting and novel. Yeah. Um, it wasn't huge. You know, um, video games do that so much better. Yeah. you know, if you really want to control all your outcomes and and design the design the worlds you're playing in and all those kind of things that I think video games is a better outlet for doing that. What do you tell me what we're eating? Uh, this I think is cottage cheese. This This is some kind of peach with sourdough bread. Okay. And this is lamb. Oh, cool. I like lamb. Okay. Um, yeah. So, I I mean, they definitely I look at things that happen on the TV that compete for time on TV. Mhm. And games are definitely a part of that. Yeah. We can go back to the Netflix story. So you started sending DVDs in a world where VCRs were ruling the roost. Yeah. You went from delivering them in 3 weeks to del delivering them the next day or the same day and all of that. Blockbuster started to die. Netflix started to rise. When did the switch from sending something physically to almost sending something to someone's home digitally happen? And I don't need you to go into the details of this, but can you explain to me like I'm a 10-year-old boy how the tech behind it works? the cost of storing on a server, the cost of me making a call from my device that I want this particular video and the cost of streaming it because this I will tell you as a member or as a subscriber of Netflix and every other streaming platform there is, you guys are doing something right which others have not caught on to. Like if I were to watch a movie on Amazon, even the forwarding experience when I go from minute 5 to minute 30, yeah, it is so much more seamless on Netflix. Uh these tiny things like UI I feel are the difference between everything the the tiny stuff. Can you tell me like broad picture what what does that look like? Well, you got to keep in mind when we started doing this, the vision was always to be a digital delivery business. So, all the work that was going into this all started back in day one. Mhm. Um, it's the the the the technology itself, you know, for it's on demand, it's streaming, it's not downloading, it's not mass live. So, it's really optimized for point-to-point delivery. And the biggest thing that we've put a lot of money and and uh and effort into is every device that's connected to the television, Netflix is individually optimized for that adi for that device. So things like early on, one of the things we're finding is Netflix would work better when your connection's faster. Mhm. And sometimes your connection would slow down on you and the it would start buffering and that's the worst thing that can happen in a stream. So they built in the ability to downshift basically send you a lower lower res picture for a minute while the while your speed catches up and it all happened in a cache behind the scenes so you never felt it. So very very subtle very gentle down you know a degradation of picture quality for a few minutes then comes right back. So that's stuff we were working on at the very beginning of streaming because they knew that this you know that was not going to be acceptable way to watch a movie. um the the work that goes into picture quality that goes into compression uh that goes into having building uh this open connect system that actually puts the data physically nearer people's prop homes so it's not traveling so far on the internet helps the delivery system content delivery services uh get serve us better and us cheaper to serve us than anybody else. But we did all that work and invested it for almost I would bet all the other entertainment companies their second biggest biggest expense is marketing and ours is tech second and only to content. M so the the the model itself is not it's not about whether or not how the technology itself works whether or not it's optim it's perfectly optimized for variable speed variable device variable connection all meant to do the same thing which is not to not to get stuck you know uh and deliver the most high quality experience possible sound and v video and audio so we had in the earliest days of Netflix when we had terrible quality of content The content was lousy what we were streaming. We had people doing what they called golden eye test on the stream to make sure the stream looked beautiful because eventually the content was going to get good. So I think most people when they saw Netflix growing up, they thought, \"Oh, that's that's easy. We'll buy some off-the-shelf software and and and stream. Everyone can stream. Look at YouTube's doing it.\" You know, that kind of thing. Uh but the truth of it is it's really hard and it's really complicated especially in a multi-device world and with variable speed and speeds of connection and sometimes you see it break down like on the live the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight you know we pushed the internet right to the limits uh that night uh but we learned so much now we got a lifetime of learning that night so that you see the NFL on Christmas day troublefree so so to me it's like for us we are a tech company that got into entertainment Um, we we still have a very much of a of a tech DNA even though we've become primarily a tech entertainment company, but our DNA is still very much a tech company. So, in a way, you're you don't have one USP, but you have two. One is content curation and the other is tech. Is that right? Yeah. But if if no matter how good the content is, the delivery is bad, it doesn't matter. And then and vice versa is true too. So the tech the tech can be beautiful if the content's terrible people still are going to turn you off. But tech more important than the content even I think I think it's the cost of entry. It's table stakes. The tech has to work better. And I think what you just described almost everyone describes to me that. Yeah. That why can't they do it as well as you do? Why why does it not work when I push play on this one? Yeah. You know. So So I met the YouTube CEO a couple of days ago, Neil. Yeah. He's a good man. Is he competition? Yeah, for sure. For definitely same thing for time and attention and increasingly for ad dollars. Yeah. Cuz he's doing movies and you will do music at some point, right? That will do music. Yeah. No, no, but you will do there's plenty of music out there. It's, you know, and it's kind of I think it's a very different business model. But you will do like podcasts and individual content creators putting up content. I think there's a um there's a class of creators on YouTube that is pretty close to professional content. I kind of think of them as kind of proam creators. The things they're doing look pretty great. Um podcast is a form of user, you know, user generated content. U the line between talk show and a podcast are getting pretty blurry. Yeah. Like we have 20 people working on this. So I don't know what we are. Yeah. Yeah. So there's no reason that wouldn't be on Netflix. I actually believe that uh it the the that content will better monetize on Netflix than it does on YouTube. Not all of it, but certain for certain class, you know, creators, it certainly would. So, we'll look we'll look to do that. Yeah. So, we don't monetize any of our content. We don't have ads. We don't have sponsors. It's largely like a charity project around entrepreneurship in India. Mhm. But for people like us where we put it freely on everything without ads. Yeah. Sitting behind a for you the reach is the most important part. Yeah. Yeah. Sitting behind a platform kind of doesn't make sense cuz then you can't be on every other platform. Right. So for someone like me say we produce content we don't produce a lot of it but the little bit that do we put that we do put out is great quality and we do it here at WTF which is this channel. I have a broking business. We produce a bunch of content from there. So we have maybe 10 20 different things which are parallelly running at any [Music] time to bring that under a umbrella and be able to compete with a larger distributor. What do you think we can do? Is there a shot? Like if you had to suggest a playbook of building a why do you want to compete with them? Why not just co-op them? The problem is while we distribute on them, we never know we don't get to touch our subscribers in a way. We don't know their names, we don't know their email ids, we don't know their phone numbers, we don't know who they are, what is working, what is not working. uh like take your example a movie producer who's independent will never have access to the kind of data Netflix has access to. You might know tomorrow with cameras on television sets or mobile phones that you could probably gauge when the pupils of a certain person dilate when they're watching a certain character do a certain thing in a particular movie. So if you don't control the medium, you don't access the data. In turn, you can't. It's like trying to compete with 100 the data that someone else has. Tomorrow, YouTube will make their own content like Netflix makes their own. It happens in every industry, right? You look at a food delivery platform. Yeah. When you don't know who you're if I'm a restaurant and I may never I mean it's one of that's an interesting one because I think that business has got content creators willing to give them their programming for free. Yeah. So in fact if they start paying for any of it it might screw up the whole system. So, so that may be the one difference. But I do think that there's I think about it in terms of like companies like Shopify where companies most of the companies on Shopify mostly are also sell on Amazon and have all those dynamics you talk about but they use Shopify to present their brand. They use it to get learning. they all the learns that you're talking about that they're getting from being more direct feeling like they're more direct to consumer and then apply those things to Amazon the best they can to their Amazon selling the best they can. So I think that might be the same thing with YouTube. There's a lot of third party companies that analyze YouTube analytics that can tell you all the things that you would know if you owned YouTube. But they would never let me touch my subscriber even with the third. Yeah, you have to do other things to do that. That's what again what the Shopify does is it creates creates touch points with consumers, right? Yeah. In fact, a lot of the new business models I see on YouTube is build distribution on YouTube, then figure out a way to transition your subscribers out of it. Yeah. And then in turn you can engage with them. It's like food delivery, right? My uh the restaurant in my neighborhood that I order from all the time started putting a thing in the bag that said, you know, order from me directly, please, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Uh so Netflix we had gotten to the time where you spent the initial years figuring out the tech. This is after you have solved the blockbuster problem evolved beyond that. What happened next? You figured out how to stream using technology in a manner that is more convenient, faster, no latency than the incumbent players or anybody. You didn't have any incumbents back then, right? There was no competition for streaming. I mean, we started streaming almost the exact same time that Amazon and Hulu did in the US. So, and and started originals almost the exact same time, right? So, we were we were watching how all three of us were running for running for the same prize at that time. Most of one of our concerns was that Hulu did a lot of TV and Netflix because of our DVD roots, we were kind of known as a movie company and we really wanted to make sure that we didn't become the movie company and Hulu became the DV the TV company. Mhm. So that's why we kind of got into TV at the same time, licensing TV shows. What happens to old school TV? The TV that I grew up on, like the TV where I used to go I still remember I used to go home from school at 300 p.m. and watch this particular cartoon called SWAT Cats and Powerpuff Girls and Teenage Mut and I used to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I remember watching all these Indian soaps, you know, with my mother like late in the night, Kyunki, Sasby and all of that. What happens to that entire industry? I mean, I guess a lot of it shows up in in retro channels. I think that there'll be an economic model where we we'll have more of it over time. Um, these fast services that are mostly ad supported. I think those are mostly delivering most of those episodes to people. YouTube certainly does some of that, right? So, But I feel like there's a lot of different ways to get to it. No one's going to be making shows like that anymore, right? Um, which is kind of interesting. I I can never figure out why uh a show that worked for a seven-year-old this year doesn't work for a seven-year-old two years from now. Uh, but but it's because the the marketplace moves so fast. Kids now, you know, mostly want to it's more aspirational. So by the time you get to seven now, you want to watch what 10-year-olds watch. Do you see a shift in content where I know this can't be specific for India and the US? They're probably completely different. But what is working in the US today and what is working in India? Somebody was telling me that crime, horror, spirituality are ruling the roost in India. Is that different in the US? It's secular too. You know, um, crime is very big. People love true crime. Mhm. I mostly think because people I don't think because people are macob. I think they will like crime because they're, um, pro puzzle solvers, problem solvers, and we're trying to trying to solve a puzzle. I think it's very built into our DNA to figure things out. I think I think of religion is is that why did people go west in the United, you know, in the US when they landed um to get to the next thing and fight figure it all out? people want to know how how it began and how it ended um and figure out all those things. So I actually think people are very curious and that that true crime scratches the puzzle itch that people have but yeah so that's very very universal works everywhere. So talking about Netflix in India specifically I think you have two incumbent I would say competition for the lack of a better word sport cricket for one of them for Disney hot star geio hot start now has been a big funnel to get in a large audience uh cricket is a religion in India if You put IPL on a certain platform, it changes everything. Yeah. You have taken a slightly more nuanced approach where you're not taking the very expensive broadcasting rights of a sport, but like you did on F1, you create a documentary behind it and it works just as well. Yeah. Would you like to elaborate as to why you did that and your thoughts around that? Formula 1 is probably the best example of the theory playing out for me. I believe that big sports cricket in in India, the NFL in the United States is those leagues are so powerful the the consumer demand for them is so high. They should get all the money. So whoever's delivering it, it's just a distribution business. Should be very very low margin just for distribution only. So if if I have that game and then next week I lose it and it goes to the next person that audience that whole audience can go from here to here. So at the end of the day I don't know why you would lose a lot of money on a sport because it's you'll never get to the place where it's profitable. So and you probably can't make enough profit on everything else that you can lose too much on that sport. So one of the tests for for me was to what you just described with Formula 1. We built this show called Drive to Survive. Formula 1's very popular around the world but weirdly unpopular in the United States. We people didn't know the sport. They didn't know how it works. They didn't know these people. It's play it's race the races are in the middle of the night. So um it just never got popular. So we did this documentary series introd what I loved about the sport and why I thought it' make great television. It's you know beautiful people doing dangerous things in beautiful places. You know that's pretty good TV. Uh and that's what happened. I think people tuned in to the shows. They learned about the the the drivers and they figured out how the rules work. They got more and more interested in watching races. So when the deal came up, I thought, okay, now we have an audience of Formula 1 fans. The the audience has gone up, but not dramatically. It's gone up two or three times though from what it was. It was very small. Mhm. the the rights. So, let's just say I was holding those rights. When that contract came up because of all the all the brand building I did for Formula 1, that fee went up 10 times. That's that would have been my reward for growing Formula 1 is my fee would have gone up 10 times. So I look at it like um big league sports likely the league owners keep all the profits always and you can now what we're doing now our version of this would be something like the NFL on Christmas day where we actually create a Netflix event around it where we have backto-back football on the that day we have Beyonce concert in between and it was a real kind of a fun like Christmas day pro piece of programming that's very unique to Netflix uh and that a reason to have Netflix is for that day. Um, so that's the way our our kind of take on it or creating the big sport event oursel like we did with the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson's fight. Is that the way me aspiring to create content? Like you told me earlier that the best lowhanging fruit to build a business in this field is to produce content. You've told me go local. You've said duration doesn't matter. You said familiarity is actually a good thing because people click it. If I were to build something around sport, then should I look at building a reality show on top of cricket for example? I mean it's you've yet to have an interesting take on it that someone else hasn't yet, right? But yeah those stories there's a lot of stories to be told. this entire subscription model Ted like India has struggled with that like I know maybe Disney Hot Star or Geo Hot Star now has 50 60 100 million subscribers who are paying some kind of a fee but I find that subscribing for something is not an easy sell in India. uh advertising is palpable but why do why do you is definitely true why do you think why do you think that is there it's something in the culture I don't know like I've thought of this like when we've thought of media business we considered can we have a subscription fee where we charge people every month for a media business that we were ideating when you come down to extrapolating one part of it is affordability I think there might be a 100 or 200 million people in India who can actually afford Yeah. to spend that premium towards an additional expense in the household, right? And they have to have broadband at home and big screen TV. Yeah. Yeah. I would say 200 million. But outside of that, I feel like culturally we are averse to paying a online fee for something that is recurring in a manner that the Americans are not. Yeah. The recurring charge was definitely a cultural outside of the cultural norm. Yeah. I don't know how I I couldn't understand it either when we first got here. I thought, who wouldn't want that? It's so convenient. M but why would you want to have to go back and pay in to the credit card every month? And then somebody explained it to me. They said, \"Well, it's just it's just that is the cultural norm. What if somebody asked you for your debit card?\" Right. You would say, \"No way.\" Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because we our first efforts were because remember it was not even allowed to have recurring charges that we said, \"Oh, we should work with the government to try to see if we can change that or change the banking regulations if we can change that.\" And instead of instead of saying, \"Oh, is that what the consumer wants?\" Yeah. Yeah. And it turned out you were right. The consumer doesn't want it. Yeah. I'm trying to figure what could culturally have made us that [Music] way. We're a more savingsoriented country. Yeah. Could that be a reason that you don't the the amount of money in your bank account? We pay we place a great degree of weightage in knowing what what that number is and it makes us feel good. I um we don't I don't want to stereotype it but I feel like my experience has been that um there uh Indian people are more mindful of their money than American people are mindful to your point that you know what you have you know what you want to spend you're more mindful about it and access to credit is lower than it is in America very few people have credit cards you have this plan where you're subsidizing the monthly fee but showing advertising and I read that it's working really well for you. Yeah. And as much as 50% of new audience is coming in through that. If that were to grow and all Netflix has ads, what happens then? Well, I don't think there's ever a world where we do all all ads. It's we're a choice brand. So, um so the folks who really don't want ads, there's always going to be an option for them to do that. In fact, I think that our business will be primarily a subscription uh for the foreseeable future. We'll grow the ad business to be a good part of our business for sure. Uh but I think that even even when it's very healthy, it'll still be 20% of the business. It's interesting the the ads only model doesn't support the kind of ambitious content that we that we put on. Yeah. Um, and so the the trick is finding the right balance of ad load and entertainment or where consumers say, \"Yeah, I'll I'll take a lower fee and I I'll watch the ads and it's fine.\" Or it's like, \"Oh, we have to put on too many ads to make this even watchable.\" You've seen that, I think, happen in some other places. So, you spend more money on content now than anybody, right? Netflix. Yeah, that puts you in a position where most popular people across the world really want FaceTime with you likely. How does that change the dynamics inside your head? Uh, that's good. Well, you know, we've been in the It's been interesting because I think when we started out, even when we weren't spending as much as everybody else, we set out to be kind of artist friendly. Mhm. Uh so we had always had a disproportionate draw with talent. Uh first before it was the money, it was the better place to work. Um and for me it's very I think it's very it's very exciting part of the business to be around and working with very creative people. So um I don't I don't kid myself like a lot of like what you said. I think uh it's most it's the chair and people want to be whoever's in the chair. Yeah. Um I'm glad that today it's Bella Bajari and her team and uh who who who do most of that work today. Yeah. U but I do feel like that you know our ability to help people find big a big audience is as exciting for me as it is for them. Yeah. So but unlike a politician your chair is almost in perpetuity. You don't have a fixed term where you are reelected. Right. If things start go things don't go well along I we'll see how long that seats yeah I think it's easier to be oblivious of the chair as a corporate than it is as a elected politician who has to kind of fight for that chair periodically. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting thing because my life is all is and my wife too our lives are kind of intertwined professionally and personally. So the folks that we work with a lot of times are my among my best friends. Um so and I do think there is that that that has that relationship is always in check in that one dimension all the time like you know I don't want I don't wonder if that's why we're friends because I work here. Uh but I um but I also don't give I wouldn't I wouldn't use the friendship to move a business initiative and I hope they wouldn't either. Yeah. Yeah. Your wife used to be an ambassador. She was ambass US ambassador to the Bahamas. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Have you been married a long while, Ted? Yeah. 15 years. Yeah. And how did you meet? Uh, we met during the Obama campaign. She was she was the finance chair for California, Southern California. Uh, and I was a a guest who arrived for one of the events that she was running. U, I got there late. I was the last person to arrive. So, the very first words my wife said to me was, \"You're late. And um I get into I arrive at the event and there's a place to take a picture within Senator Obama and then go into the event. Mhm. I get there. She goes, \"You're late.\" I go, \"I'm sorry.\" She take your picture and go get your seat. So I do this thing and I get and I go to the my table and uh she comes by the table to tell the host of the table, \"If the senator is not coming to your table, if you want to meet the senator, you got to go to that table.\" So I just leaned into him. I go, \"Who is this?\" He goes, \"What do you mean?\" He goes, I go, \"Who is this woman? She's amazing.\" And he goes, \"Uh, how do you not know her? This she's this Nicole Avon. How do you not know Nicole Avon?\" And I go, \"I don't know her.\" He goes, \"Oh, I'll introduce you to her later.\" So, at the end of the night, he we left the event and went to a dinner, right? 10 of 10 people. And I'm sitting there talking to my friend Lawrence Bender, who hosted the table. And he said, \"Um, oh, here comes Nicole. Um, and she came in by herself.\" And she goes, he goes, \"Switch seats so you can talk to her. She's great. And we switched seats and I sit and talked to her. We talked for three and a half hours and eight months later we're married. Wow. She's an amazing woman. Met Nicole. I mean, yeah, I'd love to meet her. Yeah, she's really phenomenal. So Netflix in India, you don't have significant market share yet. How important is it for you as a market and how are you approaching it? like what is working for you in India and what is not working for you in India? Well, I think to your point uh earlier about the figuring out the good product market fit including payment systems and all those things early on took us a couple of years to get that right. Um I also think that you know the the as the product has ramped up our very first uh Indian original show is Sacred Games and I thought this is going to be great. This is they people in India love movies. Um, this this is a a TV show that feels as big as a movie, has movie stars. Uh, and I love the show. Well, what's interesting about it is like it was very very novel, but I didn't realize that we were going to be like introducing a brand new kind of entertainment to a country the size of India because there was nothing else like it. You know, that for TV was typically I think would be sports and talk and very not not kind of cinema infused television that we've been doing around the world. So for me it was like if I did it all over again would I have done sacred games a couple years later and did things a little some things that were more uh more populous to programming maybe maybe but we knew that India was going to be um a slower journey to get to where we want to get to but but that it's a great prize at the end of the day so I mean right now you can see how fast Indian households are adopting fixed broadband um big screen TVs growing the addressable market in India is uh exploding in the next couple of years. So it's exciting. And you have three plans in India. The cheapest one with ads I think is about 149 or 199. I can't remember the number. Are you finding traction at that level? Most of your traction at that level. No, there it's across the it's across all the programs, right? Yeah. Whatever suits the individual. Yeah. I don't want to ask you about your sharing password thing because I feel like you guys have out. Yeah, you've spoken about it enough and you've taken cognizance of that and by the way it was one of those things where that I think allowing it and promoting it even early on. It was a good way to promote the business and and a lot of people got to try it that way and those kind of things and you know a lot of companies start with free trials in some form and then eliminate them as you go which is all we did in terms of India any other nuance that you've learned in the time that you've been here that is interesting content in India I think it's interesting to me like the first thing people want to know anywhere I travel is what do people only watch here and I'm more up I'm more interested in the opposite like what how are we more this how are we the same and I was very surprised that um how international India is. I think there was a belief or conventional wisdom was that India is all Bollywood and India is all local and actually the taste of the international shows play really really well in India. So the the taste is very broad and very global. So I have a I don't know much about Bollywood like I know a little bit. I have a bunch of friends who work in Bollywood or in the media or content space. Uh whoever I ran into over the last week, I kept asking them like I'm meeting dad. Tell me as an industry insider what would you like me to ask him. I asked a friend called Admu like a bunch of people hit Jane people I ran into all of last week. Each one had a different question almost. Jana is a younger lawyer uh 26 years old. He works in the entertainment zone a little bit but is primar primarily a lawyer. He was asking me in terms of content moderation and regulation. Is there a different benchmark you apply on a country by virtue of micronamics in the country like when you're regulating content how do you look at India? We try obviously we program the the the sensibilities of the audience but I do think you know we're usually try to be mindful and respectful obviously always follow local law when it comes to these things around the world um and lean into expression a little you know for protect free speech with of the artist and uh but also don't do things that are u uh unnecessarily provocative. If I get inspired by the conversation I hear today, I'm in the audience and I set about ideulating what kind of content to build. Can you tell me one theme that I should build in one specific theme like a micro theme? No. Cuz I don't think you can reverse engineer into something that we want, you know. No. Yeah. No, you kind of Do you have an algorithm like YouTube has one? What do you favor? Definitely not on on green lighting. No. Uh the idea really mostly it is the quality of the storytelling. Is this a world that people are going to want to spend time in? Are these people people care about? Do I care how these people what happens to these people? Do I all stick with them till the end? And that that is very unintuitive what the what what will the what will give you to a get you to a yes on any every one of those or all of those or any of those. So for me it's like be careful not to kind of reverse engineer your way into a pitch. just you have to write a story that people have got to see and you've got to make. So when Netflix is greenlighting a project today, is it data or is it gut? It's gut. Yeah. Yeah. I mean remember you've got you're picking stories that you you're predicting someone's going to want to see. You're predicting will this person be able to deliver this vision to the screen? Have they ever done it before? Sometimes sometimes they've never done it before. So you really are going with the creator and betting on the creator and betting on the story that they pitch to you. Yeah. Is there baggage of a founder uh Ted? Like Reed was a fairly popular CEO and founder of Netflix. Yeah. When you fill someone's shoes, somebody like him, this is useful for anybody taking over a company which was run by a very popular, magnanimous character. What do you have to watch out for? I think you you really just want to be yourself. Don't try to be him because you're not you're not him. Um, you know, he we talked about the succession of the company. Reed talked about it with the board 10 years ago, right? Um, when I met him in 1999, in a way he was talking about succession. He said to me, I'm building a company that's going to be around longer than me, which which implies succession, right? So, he uh it's always been on his mind. He asked me to be the co-CEO with him about seven years ago, five, six years ago. Mhm. Um, which was a very unusual step for a founder CEO to take a co-CEO. Um, and but it was all part of his long-term plan, which was, you know, I think that this business, he and I, Reed and I had been practical co-CEOs before that, me doing the entertainment, Reed doing the tech. Um, and then we just kind of, he kind of memorialized it by giving me the title. Uh, and I broaden broadened my scope a little bit. But I think in his head he said, I think this co-CEO thing is the right way to do it. And so when we when we when he talked about him actually moving on uh it was the move to another co-CEO me and Greg Peters uh in in very similar model that I have that we have with Reed but neither of us we both have our strengths we both have our weaknesses neither of us are Reed and we don't try to be. Do you think that's a good idea having coco? I'm just like it's very odd. It's odd that it doesn't because it doesn't work in many there's a lot of stories where you can look back and u there were three co- Roman emperors that didn't go very well. But if you look back in at the the track record of the co-CEOs and it's spotty. Uh but I think where it really works well here is we do two very distinctly different things. We manage two different distinctly different cultures with inside the business with tech culture and entertainment culture or even physically in two different places in California. Um, and it enables us to be to bring out the best in ourselves in the in the things that we do provide technical guidance and inspiration for people in an area that we're not where we have our sea legs. Um, and I think it helps for recruiting. uh people want to work for people that know what they're, you know, what they're doing in the area that you're coming to work for us on. Um so and and I think it doesn't it may not work at every company that does what we do even because I feel like the company is inherently free of politics. Um all the things in the culture deck, we're not Greg and I wouldn't backstab each other in the back for this job. Um we both want this thing to work forever. Uh the same way I didn't want Reed to leave. Yeah. So, um, so I really think that it'll be, uh, it uniquely works at Netflix and it may not work at every company, but I think it's worth always checking it out and testing the model out and see you have to have two people who respect each other, two people who like working with each other, uh, two people who have a unique and complimentary skill sets. If I were to put myself in your shoe, when one person leads a company to as much success as Netflix has reached, a lot of my validation will come from the chair, the position that I hold in that company at that point of time. Is it the sign of a great leader to be able to let go of your source of validation while you're getting your validation? It's remarkable, right? I mean, no, Reed's not old. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's like into sports and he's doing just that and the other. Yeah. And he set up and he set the company up better than he found it and you know, but then he started it. Um he he was confident comfortable and confident. Much of his net worth is wrapped up in the stock and so he has a lot of skin in the game whether or not that we we make this work or not. Yeah. Uh and he was very clear. He goes, \"I I don't want to come back.\" The question I ask myself is, I'm 38 today. Today's your birthday? No. No. Oh, okay. 38 now. Wow. You chose tonight to do your business. Okay. No, I'm 38 now. And how much of a role does the little validation I have affect my overall mental well-being and how much will go away if that were to be taken away? It's an interesting thought. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there there are so many people who identified themselves so much with the work. Yeah. Someone said something to me one time that they would be more embarrassed to fail at business than to fail in their marriage. I think so 100% for you. You that's you. Yeah, that's not me. But I I I know a lot of people for for whom that's true. Yeah. All my validation comes from work. I don't have much else where I'm getting the very tangible societal validation coming my way. A lot of people talk about [Music] how talk about balance and talk about your life is fulfilled when you have a b cde e in equal. That's a fantasy though. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's never a balance. Nobody has that. No. Life is perpetually way out of balance. People who say that are like just saying that. Yeah. I think it or maybe it's just aspirational that they seek life bal life work balance but there's no such thing. Yeah. It's an exercise in futility to to try to chase it. Yeah. In fact, it's probably you're probably shortch changing one or the other all the time. Yeah. Uh if you're if you're trying to get that Yeah. Yeah. I always feel like I'm letting someone down. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's either your mother or your That phrase that life work balance was designed to make you feel bad. Yeah. Yeah. Are you hard on yourself? Yeah, very. Yeah. In the work realm or in the family realm? I think both. Um I probably um it's my the my kids now are adults, so there's a it's the there's less of the those kind of trade-offs that you make in business for family life. Um, but I um always felt very guilty about the trade-offs you make. Even though you've convinced yourself, well, I work this hard to provide for this family so we could be this, we could do this and we could do that and we could do this. Uh, but ultimately there's, you know, probably they would have preferred the time. What do they do today? Um, my daughter is a producer, a film producer. Um, just produced a movie called Bunny that uh premiered at South by Southwest and it's going to be at uh the Tribeca Film Festival next month. Um and my son is an editor, film editor. So both in the business. Any Indian editors, producers, actors that really stand out for you from the exposure you've had to India? It's such a hard question cuz I you know cuz I don't want people to say well what about me? Can you name one individual just one person who has left a lasting impression on you in the entertainment industry in India? Doing Heramande. It was probably one of the most like creatively interesting projects I've ever worked on in India. Um I was involved in the greenlight meetings for it. He came into the to LA to do the pitch. Who are you talking about? Sanjini Leven. Yes. Yeah. uh he came in with this very big vision and I think I think he almost like it was a dare like I dare you to make this it's so big uh and remember he's a cine you know he's a cinema legend so he the idea that he was going to make a TV show was almost unheard of and I almost think he wasn't going to I thought when he came for us to say no um and then when he said when we say Jess it was a long delay there was a lot of delays it was a complicated production he did things uh built these enormous practical sets that we shot on. It was something beautifully old-fashioned about every element of the production. Uh, and I was just he was so proud of and I was so proud of him. Um, and it was just such a great that stands out to me as a a real reflective of the Indian love of cinema. Try. Yeah. This is I think chicken palao. Palao is like biryani but slightly different. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, this is crazy spicy. If you want to try I can tell they put it only to you. Do you want to try it? Can you take spice? I'm going to wait. I'm going to try. Yeah. I'm going to push myself. Yeah. So, you've done some like really spectacular greenlighting of projects that nobody would have thought were reasonable. Things like Korean shows, Squid Games, Money High, there's so many in your list. I don't know where to begin and where to end. What is that skill set that allows you to make these choices that other people have not been able to make? I think a lot of you have to remember a lot of the things that um many things we passed on go on to be hit somewhere else. So don't not like you get not like your track record's all that clean. Um now remember a lot of those shows are not didn't turn out to be the show that was p being pitched either. So there's some of that goes on, but I think it's going being able to uh have a little be a little more daring about not being afraid to fail. Mhm. Um the the culture kind of instills that in us to take big swings and not being afraid to fail. Learn from the failures and move on. Um the other one is is not being stuck in this thing didn't work 10 years ago, so I'm never going to do that again. Mhm. So I didn't have a lot of guard rails around the decision-m that way. Mhm. Um, and a lot of and I think some of it is that that I talked about earlier about just general curiosity and to have some good judge of character of the people who are pitching whether or not they can actually do this thing that they're talking about. Um, the Duffer brothers when they came in with with Stranger Things, that's an example, I think, of a show that they have never done anything that big. They made one a small movie for Warner Brothers before and they directed some uh episodes of a TV show before and so we're giving them this enormous budget to make this enormous scope show and you watch this little tiny movie that they made for um for for Warner Brothers and said, \"Oh, wow. If they can make this on that little tiny budget, we got this. We got this.\" So So if I want something to be green lit by you, should I make like a demo tape? Is that the way? Well, I probably won't do it. You probably go to one of the people, many other people on the team. Yeah. Before we get to meet, but a lot of people do all kinds of pictures. Monica in India, right? Monica in India. That um but the way the way that people come in all the time, sometimes it's with a a complete episode written. Sometimes it is just a pitch and a lookbook and uh storytelling. I I love pitches. The one thing I miss the most in being the coco now is I don't get to hear many of the pitches anymore. And I loved hearing pitches and I've seen some of the best pitches for some of the worst shows and some of the worst pitches for the best shows. So, it's a I' I'm always amazed that nobody teaches anyone how to do great pitches. There should be a whole college course on just pitches because I mean that's the make or break thing when you walk into a room and I've seen people walk in with a room with a great show and just read it off the page to you while you're like sitting like this and they're just reading to you. Um, if I had to pick one thing over another, say I'm going to pitch to Monica and hopefully would I do better with a lookbook, a script for an episode or a demo 3 minute video of the look and feel of the show? I bet with Monica you do better with a script. Yeah, she likes I think she wants to know that you're committed and that you're you're going to deliver and that you're in, right? I'm guessing for you and her now. This is delicious. You like it? Are you a rice fan? Mhm. Do you like rice? Yeah. As a car. Yeah. So, picking a micro culture like the Korean stuff Yeah. before it has blown up and making it mass. How do I learn to do that? Say for example, I have to make the decision on producing or not producing ABC, B, C, and D. Somebody comes to me with a Korean drama 5 years ago and says we should do something like this. I'd be like, heck no. What skill set do you have that allowed you to make that call and how can I inculcate it? I think it goes back to the video store. The beauty part of working in a video store, they were empty all day. Mhm. All the business happened after after work. So all day I watched everything. I watched everything in the store. So one thing that I have that some people don't is I've seen almost everything. So when someone comes in with an idea or a pitch, I already have some framework for where I've seen it before, where it's worked, what didn't work about it, not just in American film from. So when when we did a in Korea before Parasite, we made Bangjun Hose movie called Oakja. Mhm. And I was very familiar with his work. I've seen all of his film before. And he was um I remember that what where he was in his life at that time. He told me a story that there was a a box set of Korean movies on DVD that Martin Scorsesi did the director's commentary on and then he's talking about movies in Korea and he was and he and he Bong said and Martin Scorsesi said my name. He got very excited to tell me that Martin Scorsesi said his name and I said have you never met Martin Scorsesi? He goes no. So I introduced them and had set it up so that Bong could go to his home and they went and spent the day together and it was really exciting. But again, I I think when Bong was out pitching that movie, a lot of people did not know him and his work outside of Korea. Um he he was, you know, an incredible an incredibly well-known director, particularly in Korean horror. Um so, but again, you kind of you you got to have some frame of reference. So, does familiarity play a part in that? You've seen something similar which has worked so you will greenlight something similar. I think it's just you Mart Scorsesei said that all movies are in conversation with each other. So you have to watch a lot of movies to understand what the connection is. You know this is like that but it's not really like that. You know it's this but it could be a little more like this but that that will never work in India but it works well in Korea. You know those kind of things. And what does well or does not? Is it a factor of reading the room like reading what is happening in society today or is it about the quality of content? Like we're in a world where I don't know left is going right and the politics are changing, capitalism and the way we view it is changing. So much is changing. Yeah. Youth sentiment on social media is changing. Does that define what will work or not tomorrow or will it be the quality of content? The reason it's so hard to predict is because sometimes it changes because of what's happening in the culture and sometimes the exact opposite. Meaning that because things are so ex because things are so black, people really want white now or because everything's black everything must be black. Mhm. So I I do think that there's a almost impossible to predict nature of how society will react to what's happening in society far enough in advance to get something made. Another thing that is big for Netflix is DEI. You have people of different race, religion, spread ac ethnicity, spread across different parts of Netflix from greenlighting to leading different roles and all of that. Is it working? is like the popular narrative as an outsider sitting in India when I hear about what is happening in America. Everyone's talking about you know DI having caused the issue in some college and how it's not necessarily the best thing for business. Is DI in Netflix helping Netflix produce better content and be a better streamer? Well, look, we're telling stories for 700 million people around the world. Mhm. We need the people who are picking them to people who are making them, people are promoting them to be a lot like the audience that they're serving. So that diversity very much plays into our success. So I and there I don't believe that there's any conflict with getting the best person and having a diverse workforce. For a long time, you sat on the very top end of Indian streaming. By top end I mean you cater to the not completely but to the English niche audience and you were the most expensive of services. Of late you're getting very popular shows uh like Capell Sharma and I heard something about C. These are more domestic language talk shows in a way. Uh can you be both? Can you sit on that end and and on this end? I mean, that's the beauty of the personalization work that we've been doing since the company began is we're not doing those shows instead of doing these other shows. We're doing those in addition to them. So that if you like these kind of shows, then that's what you'll see on Netflix and if you don't, you'll see other things. So, um, we're broadening the offering, not narrowing it to something else. What is what is working like all the data you have on India now, which is significant in all the time that you've been here. Can you tell me some nonobvious insights you have learned that I won't know? I I'm sure that you would probably be the the international performance of con of programming from Japanese anime uh to Turkish soaps to all kinds of different things that you would not expect would work very well in India. Work very well in India. Is that we don't speak the language? I I I I think for some reason and you probably understand better than I do, the audience has got very is very hungry for diverse storytelling from around the world. They love Bollywood. They love South Indian action movies. They love all those all local content for sure, but far more adventurous as viewers than I expected. Could it go back to the projection lens that people want to show you what they're watching so that they can speak about the fact that they watch the Korean? I don't know. Maybe to each other. Maybe to each other, but I don't think so. I think it's what they like. They would turn it off. They give it, you know what I mean? They would just hit play for a minute, then turn it off. Uh cuz but honestly, they're watching and loving content from around the world. Uh, I watched this interview of yours where the journalist was telling you you're killing Hollywood and you were talking about how you're saving Hollywood. Yeah. Explain. You might be saving. I can't explain why he said you're killing, but yeah, I think saving is look at what we're doing. I mean, we're continuing to be able to create an environment where we can get films made and TV shows made. M um and doing it in a way that I think what's what's what I think is killing Hollywood is where people forgetting the audience and and for us it's like we're we're obsessive on on the audience and serving them how they want the way they want the content they want the programming they want uh and doing it really well and it's like and the the numbers speak speak for themselves where people are what they're doing what they're not doing um and so I think we're on to the right track by listening to customers like listening to the to the audience what do you think happens next in the podcasting world, the independent content creators who are not not sitting behind any organization. Yeah. How does that world evolve? Does Netflix start competing there? Look, I think the more podcasts become forward uh video forward um and people are watching on TV, which they are more doing more and more frequently, it's very likely a lot of those will could end up on Netflix. Not all of them, but I do think the but there's a there's a place on Netflix for them and where they could we could out we could monetize better than it being out everywhere else where they uh where you find podcast because we have a big enough distribution platform to bring most of the audience to you the same way. So possibly we're we're looking at all of them. So I'd say the um the breadth of places that we're looking for new storytelling and new creators uh is bigger than it used to be. It's not just film school. It's not just a film festival. A lot of times it's YouTube and Tik Tok and Instagram. Are they eating up a lot of the mind share that used to go to fiction? No. Um I don't know what they're trading off for. So like our we're not dropping and they're growing. Um it could be that they're just accelerating the decline of linear television. Uh which it wouldn't be a bad thing for us. Um so but I do think what people are using the TV for is very interesting how how evolved it just in the last couple of years. A lot of people tell me Ted that the youth have no patience. They're dead scrolling all the time and their ability to do one thing for a prolonged duration is limited. But then I know many many young people who are watching 10 hours of a Netflix show without a break or maybe 15 or 20 hours. Yeah. So who's right? I I I have not given up on the attention span of youth. I when Squid Game drops, they're going to stop everything they're doing and watch Squid Game in two days. Yeah. Yeah. So, is it increasing or decreasing? I think you have you got to entertain them. You have to be we have to be more entertaining than dead scrolling. Binging. You have to out binge dead scrolling. Dead scrolling is like short-term spurts of dopamine, right? Yeah. What chemical is Netflix catering to when you're watching a 10-hour show? I like I think if our common references as a culture are memes. Yeah. That's depressing. Me they're throw because they're throwaway. You know what I mean? You would know people of a certain age don't even don't won't even know the things that you and I were talking about tonight. So I I feel like what's great about it is is that we're getting into their soul, getting into their heart, getting into their, you know, into the into their own experience. The way that you think about a movie that you grew up with, the way I remember seeing Jaws at 10 years old in the movie theater, people screaming, popcorn flying in the air, that's that's part of who I am and that's what we're trying to we're tapping into that. You have an interesting marketing strategy where you where you produce content to market content. Does that work? When Oh, mean producing like a podcast to promote the show? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Why does that work versus say a billboard or a holding or I think it works in conjunction with all those things. It does not in place of so there's you have to touch you have to have a lot of touch points to get in the culture these days there's a lot of things competing for your attention. So sometimes if you're really deep in you're a big podcast listener or watcher uh and we have a and you're also a true crime lover that that true crime podcast about this show upcoming it's a natural right and that works. So if I made content if I produced a 10p part 1 hour series about something let's say about the financial markets what would my go-to strategy be? I've met Monica and you and you guys have green lit it. You paid for me to produce it. Everything is done. I need to create a buzz about it because it's coming on Netflix's homepage tomorrow. Yeah. Where would I go? Like would it luckily you have a great following of entrepreneurs, right? So if if you make a show like that and it doesn't appeal to your base, it's doomed. So you you can go out. No, I mean I mean not for me specifically. No, say you someone like you, you go out to your base if it's huge or if it's even small. Uh, and then the have the have that echo and it get larger and larger. Do you think any competition could come for YouTube, Instagram, Twitter? I know each of them do a different things, but are you seeing something that I have not seen in terms of competition? They all have these things all have life cycles. Yeah. you know remember MySpace. Yeah. Any that you think is nearing the end of their life cycle that that I can't call that I can't call the the crit the global critical mass that exists today for for uh for Tik Tok for Instagram for YouTube is pretty tough pretty tough to challenge gaming we didn't speak about this you're planning to set you planning to bring in a lot of gaming and OTT yeah can you elaborate how will that work? Yeah, because a TV remote is a very inconvenient way to play a game. Yeah. So, a lot of it um was coming in where you could just play play on your mobile as part of your subscription. Uh and then now we're optimizing some of the games for TV as well, including multi multiplayer party games and those kind of things too. So, it's basically meant to be like you've asked earlier about does games compete with Netflix sometimes and it competes for time and energy and screen time. So when we we want to be part of that with uh with those people who love gaming and this wouldn't be large AAA games. They would be like the light a little bit of both. I mean we you know we've licensed a lot of large AAA games that are in the program now. Uh Grand The Grand Theft Auto games by way of example. They do very very well. Uh and then these other there's other like mostly like games for younger people, puzzle games, all kinds of games just like Netflix itself with the way we have documentary and film and television foreign language. Yeah. I don't have any questions per se, Ted. Any fleeting thoughts? Like anything you'd like to say? Ad If you were to presume for a second that you're talking to a 20-year-old Indian boy or girl who wants to start a business in media content. Anything you'd like to say to them? I I think that young people, you said they're short attention span. I do think they're impatient. Um, and I do think that a lot of these a lot of media jobs particularly, um, if you're going to start a media business, you to be very successful, you're going to want to know how to do everything that everyone's doing. And the best way to do that is to start at the bottom, put in the time and work for work at a company, be a production assistant on a on a film, go get coffee for a writer's room, all those kind of things that you didn't think you wanted to do. But if you want to do a run, if you want to run a business in this part, you're going to have to learn how how all those things operate and how all those people work if you want to be successful. And the best way to do it is to do it. And this is the beauty of being young is you put in a little bit of time and figure out as soon as you learn what you need to learn. Soon as you find that this part may be for by the way you may discover the avenue that you really been looking for all the all along uh by spending that time in the writer room or on set or in post-prouction or the VFX house uh as an assistant where you have opportunity to learn and be mentored. So uh I would say don't be impatient. Mhm. Uh take your time, learn the roles, learn the jobs, learn the people who do those jobs, and see if that's really what you want to do. Any leading words for India in your very short visit here? Every time I I'd say for 10 years, uh I've heard that India is 2 years away. Yeah. And I feel like it's never been more true right now. I mean, it just feels like there India is on a precipice of something very big. Uh and this is probably the the most exciting time. uh that I've been aware of in India's history. Done. All right. Thank you. Good time. Thanks everyone. Thanks. Did you have fun? Yeah, very much. Yeah. Shah Ruk directs movies as well. Oh, you're talking about The Sun. The Sun. Oh, you guys bought the show? Yeah. Yeah. You're producing it in Bollywood. Yeah. Yeah. It's very fun. I've watched the first two watched the first two episodes so far. What do you think of it? It's very funny. It's kind of like, you know, um people I think people in India and people outside of India know nothing about the inner workings of Bollywood. So, it's a really fun world. Yeah. No, sweet guy. I really like He's a good director. He's a very good director. Yeah. Yeah."
